# A sample HuggingFace Chat assistant

This folder contains resources from Zerodha's varsity. The idea is to simply leverage HuggingChat and create a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based chat assistant. The assistant created using the resources present in this folder would specifically aid in learning finance concepts. The HuggingChat assistant can be found in the link - [Zerodha Varsity Assistant](https://hf.co/chat/assistant/66a9a1e4c4b5a760a3d567f9)
