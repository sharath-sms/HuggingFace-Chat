CHAPTER   1   
Background   and   Orientation   
  
1.1-   What's   in   the   name?   
I   recently   heard   Joe   Rogan's   podcast   with   Naval   Ravikant.   This   is   a   2-hour  
conversation   and   I   think   this   is   one   of   the   most   thought-provoking   and  
stimulating   conversations   I've   heard   in   a   while.   The   topics   discussed   are   quite  
scattered   and   covers   a   diverse   set   of   topics,   but   it   has   a   great   flow   to   it   with  
one   thing   leading   to   another.   I'm   awestruck   with   Naval's   multi-disciplinary  
approach   to   many   things   in   life   including   inner   peace,   creativity,   capitalism,  
and   of   course,   wealth   creation.   The   granular   clarity   he   has   on   these   topics   is  
quite   impressive.   I'd   suggest   you   check   out   the    podcast/YouTube   video    if   you've  
not   already   done   that   yet.    
For   obvious   reasons,   the   wealth   creation   bit   lingered   on   in   my   mind   for   a  
while.   I   was   thinking   about   what   Naval   said   in   this   podcast   and   it   resonated  
with   everything   I   have   ever   learned   and   experienced   with   money   and   my   own  
pursuit   to   generate   wealth.   I'm   nowhere   close   to   the   'financial   freedom'   state  
he   describes   in   the   podcast,   but   at   least   I   know   that   I'm   not   deviating   much  
from   the   track.   While   I   continue   this   journey,   I   thought   why   not   share   some   of  
my   experiences   and   learning   with   you   all.   
Hence   this   topic   on   'Personal   Finance'.   
When   you   think   about   personal   finance,   it   oen   circles   around   planning   your  
financials   today,   so   that   you   have   a   better   tomorrow.   While   some   can   do   this  
  




2    
themselves   (or   so   they   believe),   few   consult   a   financial   advisor   to   chart   this  
map   for   them.   However,   I'm   not   a   big   fan   of   approaching   a   financial   advisor  
to   help   you   chart   a   plan   for   yourself   and   your   family.   You   should   be   able   to   do  
this   yourself   and   your   family.   
Aer   all,   you   know   your   family   and   their   requirements   best.   You   know   what   is  
good   for   the   family   and   what   is   not.   You   work   hard   for   your   family   today   and  
dream   of   a   secure   future   for   them.   
Your   'Financial   Advisor',   won't   do   any   of   this.   
He   is   most   likely   eager   to   peddle   you   a   financial   product   that   will   earn   him   a  
good   return.   He   will   do   the   same   with   you   and   20   other   clients   he   may   have.   
So   eventually,   the   onus   is   on   you   to   secure   your   family's   and   your   own  
financial   wellbeing.   Remember,   this   is   called   'Personal'   finance   for   a   reason.  
Its   best   kept   personal   and   dealt   with   care   and   diligence.   
Good   news   is,   this   is   not   rocket   science.   If   you   have   the   skills   to   do   basic  
arithmetic,   then   half   the   battle   is   won.   The   rest   of   the   work   is   just   the  
application   part   where   you'll   figure   what   is   good   and   what   is   not.   
This   is   exactly   the   objective   of   this   module.   At   the   end   of   this   module,   you   will  
be   in   a   position   to   do   these   things   -   
Develop   a   deeper   understanding   of   financial   products   and   what   goes   under  
the   hood   
Set   up   a   financial   goal   and   work   towards   achieving   that   
Identify   financial   setbacks   and   address   towards   correcting   them   
I   hope   you   are   as   excited   as   I'm   about   this   module!   

1.2-   I'm   not   ready   yet   
Getting   my   first   job   was   a   struggle.   I   spent   6-8   month   meeting   tons   of   people,  
desperately   looking   for   a   job.   I   finally   landed   up   with   a   'job'   to   do.   This   was  
my   first   job   and   it   was   special.   Aer   working   for   a   month,   I   got   my   first   pay  
cheque   ever   and   I   was   ecstatic.   I   felt   responsible   for   the   first   time   in   my   life.   
I   had   a   bunch   of   things   planned   with   my   first   pay.   Right   from   buying   my 
mother   a   saree   to   taking   my   girlfriend   (now   my   wife)   out   for   dinner   J.   Being   in  
a   position   to   do   things   for   your   loved   ones   always   feels   good.   
Aer   all   the   expenses,   I   still   had   some   money   le   in   the   account,   albeit   very  
little.   
 
A   good   friend   of   mine   suggested   that   I   should   invest   that   money.   I   brushed  
away   his   advise,   thinking   that   the   money   le   in   my   account   was   very   little  
and   would   not   make   any   diﬀerence   whatsoever.   However,   I   convinced   myself  
that   I   would   start   saving   next   month   onwards.   

As   predictable   as   it   can   get,   next   month   to   a   similar   story.   I   spent   all   the   salary  
money   and   had   nothing   le   to   save.   No   points   of   guessing,   this   continued   for  
years   and   I   never   saved   a   dime.   
Even   today,   I   regret   doing   this.   In   fact,   this   probably   is   one   of   the   top   regrets  
in   my   life.   I   wish   I   had   started   saving   early   on   in   life.   
I'm   sure   most   of   your   reading   this   may   relate   to   my   story.   We   all   brush   aside  
saving   money   today   because   the   'amount'   of   money   we   intend   to   save   is   very  
small.   We   all   keep   waiting   to   receive   a   sizable   amount   of   money   so   that   we  
can   start   our   savings   journey   with   that.   
This   never   happens   and   unfortunately,   we   never   start   saving   in   life.   
Here   is   an   advise   -   even   if   it   is   a   small   amount,   save   it.   This   will   make   a   huge  
diﬀerence   in   your   financial   life.   
Allow   me   to   tell   you   the   story   of   3   sisters   to   help   you   understand   why   you  
need   to   start   saving   early   in   life.   
A   father   had   triplet   daughters.   On   their   20 
th  
  birthday,   the   father   declared   that  
he   would   pay   each   daughter   a   sum   of   Rs.50,000/-   on   their   birthday,   till   they  
were   65   years   old.   They   were   free   to   use   this   money   in   whichever   way   they  
wanted.   
As   a   good   father,   he   also   suggested   to   his   daughters   that   they   could   invest  
this   money   in   a   promissory   note,   which   would   pay   them   a   return   of   12%  
compounded   year   on   year,   with   a   condition   that   once   invested,   they   were  
prohibited   to   withdraw   that   money   till   they   turn   65.   
Although   they   were   triplets,   their   attitude   towards   money   and   savings   were  
very   diﬀerent.   Here   is   how   each   daughter   utilized   this   money   -   
zerodha.com/varsity

5    
The   first   daughter   started   investing   right   away   i.e   on   her   20 
th  
  birthday.   She  
invested   the   first   nine   50Ks   that   she   received   in   the   promissory   note,   and   then  
the   remaining   50K   that   she   received   (from   28th   birthday   to   her   65th   birthday)  
were   all   spent   on   frivolous   things.   
The   second   daughter   initially   spent   all   the   money   she   received.   However,   on  
her   28 
th  
  birthday,   she   got   a   little   serious.   She   decided   to   save   the   same  
amount   as   her   other   sister.   So   she   saved   50K   from   her   28 
th  
  birthday   till   her  
36 
th  
  birthday,   and   the   money   she   received   from   37 
th  
  to   65 
th  
  was   spent.   
The   3 
rd  
  sister   was   a   bit   casual   till   her   28 
th  
  birthday.   She   spent   all   the   money  
she   received   from   her   dad.   However,   on   her   28 
th  
  birthday,   she   got   a   little  
serious   and   decided   to   invest   the   50k   cash   all   the   way   up   to   65   years.   
Here   is   a   summary   of   what   each   sister   did   with   the   money   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
5    

6    
 
The   first   sister   saved   for   the   first   9   years   (between   20 
th  
  to   36 
th  
  birthday)  
totaling   Rs.450,000/-.   
The   2 
nd  
  sister   saved   for   9   years   (between   her   28 
th  
  birthday   to   36 
th  
  birthday),  
totaling   Rs.450,000/-   
The   3 
rd  
  sister   started   saving   from   her   28 
th  
  birthday,   but   saved   all   the   way   till  
her   65 
th  
  birthday,   totaling   a   sum   of   Rs.1,900,000/-   
I   have   a   question   for   you   now   -   on   the   65 
th  
  birthday,   which   sister   do   you   think  
would   have   saved   the   most?   Remember,   once   the   money   gets   invested   the  
promissory   note,   it   gets   locked   till   the   65th   birthday   and   do   not   forget   the  
promissory   note   gives   a   12%   compounded   return   year   on   year.   
Pause   and   think   about   it   for   a   moment.   
zerodha.com/varsity

7    
Chances   are   here   is   how   you'd   think   about   this   -   
The   first   sister   saved   too   little,   very   early   on,   so   she   would   not   have   saved  
much   
The   2 
nd  
  sister   again   has   saved   very   little   very   randomly,   so   she   may   not   have  
much   on   her   65 
th  
  birthday   
The   3 
rd  
  sister,   although   started   late,   has   saved   quite   a   bit   and   continued   to  
save   for   the   entire   duration,   hence   she   must   have   the   highest   savings   on   her  
65th   birthday   
This   is   expected   (in   fact   I'd   be   surprised   if   it   is   anything   else)   as   we   humans  
see   things   in   a   very   linear   fashion.   Here   we   equate   the   future   value   of   our  
savings   to   the   amount   of   money   saved   today.   But   there   are   two   other  
variables   at   play   here   -   time   and   return,   both   of   these   when   concocted  
together,   works   in   a   beautiful   nonlinear   way.   
So,   here   are   how   the   numbers   stack   up   for   the   3   sister   problem,   the   numbers  
may   put   you   oﬀ   guard   so   hold   your   breath   -   
The   3 
rd    
sister   saves   19L,   which   grows   to   a   massive   3.05Crs   by   the   time   she 
turns   65   
The   2 
nd  
  sister   saves   4.5L,   which   grows   to   an   impressive   1.98Crs   by   the   time  
she   turns   65   
The   1 
st  
  sister   saves   4.5L,   however,   she   ends   up   with   a   whopping   4.89Crs   by   the  
time   she   turns   65!   
Are   you   confused?   
I'm   sure   some   of   you   are.   So   here   is   what   I   want   you   to   note   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
7    

8    
The   first   and   2 
nd  
  sister   saved   similar   amounts,   but   the   diﬀerence   was   the  
amount   of   time   they   both   gave   their   money   to   grow.   The   first   sister   gave   full  
45   years   for   the   investment   to   grow,   but   the   2 
nd  
  sister   gave   only   38   years.   See  
the   diﬀerence   it   makes?   This   is   the   reason   why   I   regret   not   starting   to   save  
early   on   in   my   life   
The   3 
rd  
  sister   ends   up   with   the   2 
nd  
  highest   corpus,   but   for   to   that   happen   she  
had   to   save   for   a   very   long   time.   But   please   note,   this   still   does   not   match   up  
to   the   1 
st  
  sister's   corpus.   
So   if   you   are   someone   like   me,   who   missed   savings   during   my   early   days,  
then   the   best   option   we   have   now   is   to   save   for   a   really   long   time.   
I   hope   by   now,   I've   convinced   you   why   you   need   to   start   saving   early.   By  
starting   early,   you   use   time   to   your   advantage   and   it   does   play   a   major   role.   
Wait   for   a   second   -   how   did   I   calculate   the   growth   of   money   for   each   sister?  
How   did   I   figure   sister   1   saved   4.89Cr   and   sister   2   saved   1.98Cr?   
Well,   this   is   calculated   by   applying   the   core   concept   of   'Time   value   of   money'.  
Time   value   of   money   is   the   central   theme   of   personal   finance.   Hence,   for   this  
reason,   we   need   to   understand   this   concept   right   at   the   beginning.   So   in   the  
next   chapter,   we   will   discuss   time   value   and   its   application   in   more   detail.   

CHAPTER    2    
Personal   Finance   Math   Part   1   
 
2.1   -   Simple   Interest   
When   it   comes   to   personal   finance,   one   of   the   key   things   to   learn   is   the   math  
that   surrounds   this   topic.   Once   you   understand   the   math   bit,   the   rest   is   just  
the   application   of   it   and   life   becomes   easy   aer   that.   
In   this   chapter,   I'll   try   and   explain   the   most   basic   math   involved   starting   from  
simple   interest.   I   know   this   is   explained   across   multiple   chapters   across  
multiple   modules   in   Varsity,   but   for   the   sake   of   completeness   let   me   include  
all   of   it   in   one   single   chapter.   
Let   us   run   through   an   imaginary   transaction,   my   guess   is   that   this   a   familiar  
situation   for   most   of   us.   

Imagine   that   one   of   your   friends   needs   money   urgently   and   he   approaches  
you   for   it.   Being   a   friend,   you   agree   to   help   him   with   the   money   but   being   a  
capitalist   at   heart,   you   also   expect   your   friend   to   pay   you   'interest'   on   the  
cash   you   lend   to   him.   I   know   we   don't   usually   ask   a   friend   to   pay   us   interest,  
but   let's   just   assume   he   is   a   friend   whom   you'd   like   to   help,   but   not   at   the  
opportunity   cost   of   your   money.   
The   transaction   details   are   below   -   
Amount   -   Rs.100,000/-   
Tenure   -   5   years   
Interest   (%)   -   10   
As   you   can   see,   your   friend   agrees   to   repay   Rs.100,000/-   over   a   5   year   period  
and   also   agrees   to   pay   you   an   interest   of   10%.   
Given   this,   how   much   money   will   you   make   at   the   end   of   5   years?   Let's   do   the  
math   and   find   out   the   details.   
Remember,   the   yearly   interest   is   paid   on   the   principal   amount.   
Principal   =   Rs.100,000/-   
Interest   =   10%   
Yearly   interest   amount   =   10%   *   100,000   
=   Rs.10,000/-   
Here   is   how   the   math   looks   -   

Interest  

 
So   as   you   can   see,   you   can   earn   Rs.50,000/-   in   total   interest   from   this  
payment.   The   amount   you   earn   from   the   interest   can   also   be   calculated   by  
applying   a   simple   formula,   which   you   may   remember   from   your   school   days   -   
Amount   =   Principal   *   Time   *   Return     
Where   the   return   is   the   interest   percentage.   
Amount   =   Rs.100,000   *   5   *   10%   
=    Rs.50,000/-    
I'm   sure   you'd   agree   that   this   is   quite   straightforward   and   most   of   you   would  
remember   that   this   is   simple   interest.   
In   simple   interest,   the   interest   gets   charged   only   on   the   outstanding   principal.   
Imagine   a   bank   transaction,   you   deposit   Rs.100,000/-   in   a   bank's   Fixed  
Deposit   scheme,   which   promises   to   pay   you   a   simple   interest   of   10%   year   on  
year   for   5   years.   At   the   end   of   5   years,   you'll   earn   Rs.50,000/-   as   interest  
income.   The   math   is   still   the   same.   

Banks   don't   pay   simple   interest,   they   pay   compound   interest.   What   do   you  
think   is   the   diﬀerence   between   simple   interest   and   compound   interest?   
2.2   -   Compound   interest   
Compound   interest   works   diﬀerently   compared   to   simple   interest.   If  
someone   agrees   to   pay   you   compound   interest,   then   it   essentially   means   that  
the   person   or   the   entity   is   agreeing   to   pay   you   interest   on   the   interest   already  
earned.   
Let's   figure   this   out   with   the   same   example   discussed   above.   The   transaction  
details   are   as   follows   -   
Amount   -   Rs.100,000/-   
Tenure   -   5   years   
Interest   (%)   -   10   
Interest   type   -   Compound   Interest   (compounded   annually)   
The   math   is   as   follows   -   
Year   1    
At   the   end   of   1 
st  
  year,   you   are   entitled   to   receive   a   10%   interest   on   the  
principal   outstanding   and   previous   interest   (if   any).   For   a   moment   assume  
you   are   closing   this   at   the   end   of   the   1 
st  
  years,   then   you   would   receive   the  
principal   amount   plus   the   interest   applicable   on   the   principal   amount.   
Amount   =   Principal   +   (Principal   *   Interest),   this   can   be   simplified   to   
=   Principal   *   (1+   interest)   
zerodha.com/varsity    
13    

14    
Here,   (1+interest)   is   the   'interest'   part   and   the   principal   is   obviously   the  
principal.   Applying   this   -   
=   100,000   *(1+10%)   
=   110,000   
Year   2    
Now   assume,   you   want   to   close   this   in   the   2 
nd  
  year   instead   of   the   first,   here   is  
how   much   you'd   get   back   -   
Remember,   you   are   supposed   to   get   paid   interest   on   the   interest   earned   in  
the   first   year,   hence   -   
Principal   *(1+   Interest)*   (1+Interest)   
The   green   bit   is   the   amount   receivable   at   the   end   of   1 
st  
  year,   and   the   blue   bit  
is   the   interest   applicable   for   the   2 
nd  
  year.   
We   can   simplify   the   above   equation   -   
=   Principal   *(1+   Interest)^(2)   
=   100,000*(1+10%)^(2)   
=   121,000   
Year   3    
In   the   3 
rd  
  year,   you'd   get   interest   on   the   1 
st  
  two   year's   interest   as   well.   The  
math   -   
Principal   *(1+   interest)   *(1+interest)*(1+interest)   
zerodha.com/varsity    
14    

15    
The   green   bit   is   the   amount   receivable   at   the   end   of   2   years,   and   the   blue   bit  
is   the   interest   applicable   for   the   3 
rd  
  year.   
We   can   simplify   the   above   equation   -   
=   Principal   *(1+   Interest)^(3)   
=   100,000*(1+10%)^(3)   
=   133,100   
We   can   generalize   this   -   
P*(1+R)^(n) ,   where   -    
P   =   Principal   
R   =   Interest   rate   
N   =   Tenure   
So,   if   you   were   to   have   this   open   for   the   entire   5   years,   you'd   receive   -   
=   100,000*(1+10%)^(5)   
= Rs.161,051/-    
Contrast   the   diﬀerence   between   the   50K   received   in   simple   interest   versus  
the   Rs.61,051/-   received   via   compound   interest.   
Compound   interest   and   compounded   return   work   magic   in   finance.   At   the  
end   of   the   day,   every   aspect   of   personal   finance   boils   down   to   the  
compounded   return.   For   this   reason,   I   think   it   is   best   to   spend   some   more  
time   trying   to   understand   the   concept   of   compounding   of   money.   
2.3   -   Compounded   returns   
zerodha.com/varsity    
15    

16    
The   concept   of   compounded   return   is   similar   to   compound   interest.   The  
concept   of   return   and   interest   is   very   similar,   just   like   the   two   sides   of   the  
same   coin.   The   interest   is   what   you   pay   when   you   borrow   money   in   any   form  
and   the   return   is   what   you   earn   when   you   invest   your   money   in   any   asset.  
Therefore,   if   you   understand   interest,   then   it   is   easy   to   understand   the   return.   
In   this   section,   you   will   learn   about   how   the   return   is   measured.   Based   on   the  
time   horizon   of   your   investment,   the   return   measurement   diﬀers.   
You   will   use   the    absolute    method   to   measure   the   return   if   your   investment  
horizon   is   less   than   a   year.   Otherwise,   if   your   investment   horizon   is   more   than  
a   year,   you   will   use   CAGR   or   the    compounded   annual   growth   rate ,   to  
measure   returns.    
I   guess   the   diﬀerence   in   absolute   and   CAGR   is   best   understood   with   an 
example.   
Assume   you   invested   Rs.100,000/-   on   1 
st  
  Jan   2019   in   a   financial   instrument  
which   yields   you   a   10%   return   (per   year)   and   you   withdraw   this   investment   a  
year   later.   How   much   money   do   you   make?   
Quite   straight   forward   as   you   can   imagine   -   
You   will   make   10%   of   100,000   which   is   Rs.10,000/-,   in   other   words,   your  
investment   has   grown   by   10%   on   a   year   on   year   basis.   This   is   the   absolute  
return.   This   is   straightforward   because   the   time   under   consideration   is   1   year  
or   365   days.   
Now,   what   if   the   same   investment   was   held   for   3   years   instead   of   1   year,   and  
what   if   instead   of   a   simple   return   of   10%,   the   return   was   compounded  
annually   at   10%?   How   much   money   would   you   make   at   the   end   of   3   years?   
zerodha.com/varsity    
16    

17    
To   calculate   this,   we   simply   have   to   apply   the   growth   rate   formula   -   
Amount   =   Principal*(1+return)^(time)    
Which   as   you   realize   is   the   same   formula   used   while   calculating   the  
compound   interest.   Applying   this   formula   -   
100,000*(1+10%)^(3)   
=    Rs.133,100/-    
Referring   to   the   previous   section,   if   you   were   to   charge   compound   interest,  
then   this   is   the   same   amount   of   interest   you   receive   from   your   friend   in   the   3 
rd 
 
year.   
Continuing   on   the   same   lines,   here   is   another   question   -   
If   you   invest   Rs.100,000/-   and   receive   Rs.133,100/-   aer   3   years,   then   what   is  
the   growth   rate   of   your   investment?   
To   answer   this   question,   we   just   need   to   reorganize   this   formula   -   
Amount   =   Principal*(1+return)^(time)    
and   solve   for   ' return'.   
By   doing   so,   the   formula   reworks   itself   to   -   
Return    =    [(Amount/Principal)^(1/time)]   -   1    
Return   here   is   the   growth   rate   or   the   CAGR.   
Applying   this   to   the   problem   -   
CAGR   =   [(133100/100000)^(1/3)]-1   
=    10%

2.4   -   The   compounding   effect   
Apparently,   Albert   Einstein   once   described   'compound   interest'   as   the   8 
th 
 
wonder   of   the   world.   I   guess   he   could   not   describe   it   any   better.   To  
understand   why   you   need   to   understand   the   compound   interest   in  
conjunction   with   time.   
Compounding   in   the   finance   world   refers   to   the   ability   of   money   to   grow,  
given   that   the   gains   of   year   1   get   reinvested   for   year   2,   gains   of   year   2  
gets   reinvested   for   year   3,   so   on   and   so   forth.   
For   example,   consider   you   invest   Rs.100   which   is   expected   to   grow   at  
20%   year   on   year   (recall   this   is   also   called   the   CAGR   or   simply   the  
growth   rate).   At   the   end   of   the   first   year,   the   money   grows   to   Rs.120.   
At   the   end   of   year   1,   you   have   two   options   -   
Let   Rs.20   in   profits   remain   invested   along   with   the   original   principal   of  
Rs.100   or   
Withdraw   the   profits   of   Rs.20   
You   decide   not   to   withdraw   Rs.20   profit;   instead,   you   decide   to   reinvest  
the   money   for   the   2 
nd  
  year.   At   the   end   of   the   2 
nd  
  year,   Rs.120   grows   at  
20%   to   Rs.144.   At   the   end   of   3 
rd  
  year,   Rs.144   grows   at   20%   to   Rs.173.  
So   on   and   so   forth.   
Compare   this   with   withdrawing   Rs.20   profits   every   year.   Had   you   opted  
to   withdraw   Rs.20   every   year   than   at   the   end   of   the   3 
rd  
  year   the   profits  
collected   would   be   Rs.   60.   
However,   since   you   decided   to   stay   invested,   the   profits   at   the   end   of   3  
years   are   Rs.173/-.   This   is   good   Rs.13   or   21.7%   over   Rs.60   earnt  

This   is   called   the    compounding   effect .    
Let   us   take   this   analysis   a   little   further,   have   a   look   at   the   chart   below:   
 
The   chart   above   shows   how   Rs.100   invested   at   20%   grows   over   a  
10-year   period.   
In   the   next   chapter,   we   will   understand   the   other   crucial   concept   in  
personal   finance   -   Time   value   of   money.   
Key   takeaways   from   this   chapter    
● Simple   interest   is   the   interest   that   gets   paid   only   on   the 
outstanding   principal   
● Compound   interest   is   paid   on   both   interest   and   the  
principal   outstanding   
● Interest   and   return   are   like   two   sides   of   the   same   coin   
● Absolute   return   is   a   measure   of   the   growth   in   return   when  
your   investment   if   for   less   than   a   year   

● Compounded   annual   growth   rate   (CAGR)   is   the   measure  
of   your   return   when   your   investment   duration   is   more   than  
a   year   
● Compounding   works   best   when   you   give   your   investments  
enough   time   to   grow   

Personal   Finance   Math   (Part   2)   

3.1   -   Money   today   versus   money   tomorrow   

For   a   moment,   assume   a   friend   of   yours   is   in   a   very   generous   mood   and  
he   gives   you   two   offers,   of   which   you   have   to   select   one   of   them.   
Option   A    -   He   gives   you   Rs.10,000/-   right   away    
Option   B    -   He   promises   to   give   your   Rs.10,000/-   exactly   two   year   from  
now    
To   add   a   little   twist,   assume   you   do   not   need   the   money   today,   but   in   two  
years,   you   are   planning   to   buy   a   new   car.   
Will   you   take   the   money   today   even   though   you   do   not   need   the   money  
or   will   you   take   the   money   two   years   from   now,   when   you   would   need  
the   money?   
zerodha.com/varsity    
21    



22    
By   the   way,   there   is   no   question   of   your   friend   backing   out   on   his  
promise   after   two   years,   he   is   a   good   guy   and   he   will   certainly   give   you 
the   promised   money.   
So   given   these   two   options,   and   the   other   things   around   it,   which   one  
are   you   likely   to   choose?   
If   I   were   to   guess,   most   of   you   reading   this   will   opt   for   Option   B.   The  
rationale   being,   that   there   is   no   real   need   for   money   today,   so   if   you  
were   to   take   the   money   today,   you'd   spend   that   money   on   unnecessary  
things   and   waste   the   money.   Hence   you   are   better   off   taking   that   money  
two   years   later.   
Assuming   the   above   were   to   be   true,   here   are   few   questions   to   you   -   
1. Does   it   make   sense   to   equate   money   across   timelines   i.e   money  
today   versus   money   tomorrow?   
2. How   do   you   move   money   across   a   timeline   to   ensure   we   compare  
the   right   value   of   money?   
To   make   the   right   decision,   you   need   to   have   clarity   on   moving   money  
across   the   timeline.   You   need   to   compare   the   value   of   money   today  
versus   the   value   of   money   tomorrow.   
The   objective   of   this   chapter   is   to   help   you   understand   just   this   i.e   to  
help   you   compare   money   across   different   timelines.   
Hopefully,   by   the   end   of   this   chapter,   you   will   be   better   equipped   to   make  
a   sensible   decision   concerning   your   friend's   generous   offer   and   of  
course   for   more   serious   things   in   life   as   investment   planning   J   
The   discussion   we   are   about   to   have   is   a   core   financial   concept   called  
the   ' Time   value     of   money '   (TVM).   The   time   value   of   money   finds   its  
application   across   many   different   areas   of   finance   including   project  
zerodha.com/varsity    
22    

23    
finance,   insurance   planning,   equity   derivatives,   valuations,   and   of   course  
personal   finance.    
The   time   value   of   money   has   two   components   -   the   present   value   of  
money   and   the   future   value   of   money.   
3.2   -   Present   value   of   money   
We   all   buy   assets   with   a   hope   that   it   will   generate   a   decent   return   over  
time.   For   example,   if   I   were   to   buy   a   piece   of   land   today   then   I   would  
expect   it   to   grow   to   a   certain   value   in   15   years.   The   amount   of   money   I  
will   receive   when   I   sell   this   piece   of   land   in   15   years   will   have   a   very  
different   value   when   compared   to   the   same   value   today.   
The   concept   of    Present   value    helps   you   understand   the   value   of   the  
funds   you   are   likely   to   receive   in   the   future   in   today's   terms.    
Sounds   confusing?   Probably   :)   
Let's   understand   this   with   an   example.   
Consider   that   you   purchased   a   piece   of   land   for   Rs.15,000,000/-   today  
and   held   it   for   15   years.   After   15   years,   you   sell   the   land   at  
Rs.75,000,000/-.   On   the   face   of   it,   this   looks   great,   after   all,   you've   made  
a   five   times   return   on   this.   
But   here   is   an   important   question   you   need   to   ask   yourself.   How  
valuable   is   Rs.75,000,000/-   that   you   will   receive   15   years   from   now,   in  
today's   terms?   
What   if   in   15   years   from   today,   Rs.75,000,000/-   is   less   valuable   than  
Rs.15,000,000/-?   
To   find   the   answer   to   this,   we   need   to   understand   two   thing   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
23    

24    
What   is   my   risk-free   opportunity   cost   today?   
Given   the   risk-free   opportunity   cost,   what   is   the   amount   that   needs   to   be  
invested   today,   such   that   it   grows   to   Rs.75,000,000/-   in   15   years.   
The   answer   to   the   2 
nd  
  question   is,   in   fact,   today's   equivalent   of  
Rs.75,000,000/-   that   you'd   receive   in   15   years.   So   let   us   figure   this   out.   
We   are   talking   about   a   15-year   time   horizon   here.   
The   opportunity   cost   is   the   equivalent   of   what   else   can   be   done   with   the  
funds   available   if   we   choose   not   to   invest   this   money   in   the   real   estate  
deal.   The   opportunity   cost   can   be   found   out   by   figuring   out   the   risk-free  
rate   in   the   economy   and   adding   a   risk   premium   over   and   above   the  
risk-free   rate.   
So   the   opportunity   cost   -   
Opportunity   cost   =   Risk   free   rate   +   Risk   premium    
The   risk-free   rate   is   the   rate   at   which   our   money   can   grow   without   any  
risk.   Of   course,   we   can   endlessly   argue   that   there   is   nothing   like   a   true  
risk-free   rate,   but   for   the   sake   of   this   discussion,   let's   assume   that   the  
risk-free   rate   is   the   Government's   15-year   bond.   Usually,   the  
Governments   are   expected   not   to   default   on   their   payments/repayments,  
hence   the   Government   or   the   Sovereign   bond   is   a   good   proxy   for   the  
risk-free   rate.   
Here   is   a   snapshot   of   all   the   available   Sovereign   bonds   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
24    

25    
 
I've   highlighted   the   2034   bond   since   we   are   interested   in   a   15-year   time  
horizon.   As   the   highlight   indicates,   the   coupon   rate   is   7.5%.   Again   for  
simplicity,   let   us   keep   the   bid-ask   yield   aside,   we   will   anyway   discuss  
these   things   in   more   detail   when   we   deal   with   bonds.   For   now,   you   need  
to   understand   that   the   risk-free   rate   for   the   next   15   years   is   7.5%.   
To   figure   out   the   opportunity   cost,   we   can   add   a   risk   premium   of   1.5-2%  
more.   The   risk   premium   really   depends   on   many   things,   keeping   it  
simple   for   now.   So,   the   opportunity   cost   would   be   -   
7.5%   +   1.5%   
=    9%.    
Now   that   we   have   our   opportunity   cost   sorted,   we   now   need   to   answer  
the   2 
nd  
  question   i.e   to   figure   the   amount   that   we   need   to   invest   today   at  
9%,   such   that   it   will   grow   to   Rs.75,000,000/-   at   the   end   of   15   years.   
A   trial   and   error   method   can   figure   this   amount.   Alternatively,   we   can   use  
the   concept   of   ' discounting ',   wherein   we   discount   Rs.75,000,000/-   at  
9%,   which   will   give   us   the   same   answer.    
The   opportunity   cost   at   which   we   discount   is   the   ' discount   rate '.    
zerodha.com/varsity    
25    

26    
By   discounting   we   are   essentially   equating   the   future   value   of   money  
(Rs.75,000,000/-   in   this   example)   to   its   equivalent   value   in   today's   terms,  
also   called   the   ' Present   Value '   of   money.    
The   present   value   forumla   is   -   
Present   value   =   Future   value   /   (1+   discount   rate   )   ^   (time)    
We   know,   
Future   value   =   Rs.75,000,000/-   
Discount   rate   =   9%   
Time   =   15%   
We   can   plug   these   numbers   in   the   equation   -   
=   75,000,000   /   (1+9%)^(15)   
=   20,590,353   
This   means,   the   present   value   of   Rs.75,000,000/-   is   Rs.20,590,353/-.   In  
other   words,   Rs.75,000,000/-   in   today's   terms   is   the   same   as   Rs.  
20,590,353/-   in   15   years.   
Given   this,   if   someone   makes   an   offer   to   buy   the   property   at  
Rs.20,590,353/-   today,   then   it   is   as   good   as   receiving   Rs.75,000,000/-   in  
15   years,   because   if   Rs.20,590,353/-   invested   at   the   opportunity   cost   of  
9%,   will   yield   Rs.75,000,000/-   in   15   years.   
The   concept   of   present   value   is   very   critical   in   finance   and   so   is   the  
concept   of   the   future   value   of   money,   which   we   will   discuss   next.   
3.3   -   Future   value   of   money   
zerodha.com/varsity    
26    

27    
The   future   value   of   money   is   simply   the   inverse   of   the   present   value   of  
money.   Going   by   the   real   estate   example,   the   future   value   of   money  
helps   us   find   an   answer   to   a   question   like   this   -   
What   will   be   the   value   of   Rs.20,590,353/-   in   15   years   from   now?   
To   find   an   answer   to   this   question,   we   again   must   find   out   the  
opportunity   cost.   Irrespective   of   future   value   or   present   value   problems  
we   are   trying   to   solve,   the   opportunity   cost   remains   the   same.   
So,   9%   will   be   the   opportunity   cost.   
To   find   the   future   value   of   money,   we   must   compound   the   amount   at   the 
given   rate   of   opportunity   cost.   
Recall   from   the   previous   chapter,   the   compounding   formula   - 
=   P*(1+R)^(n),    which   is   also   the   future   value,   therefor   -    
Future   value   =     P*(1+R)^(n)    
Where,   
P   =   Amount 
R   =   opportunity   cost   
N   =   Time   period   
Applying   this,   
=   20,590,353   *   (1+9%)^(15)   
Now,   before   I   post   the   answer   to   the   above   question,   what   does   your  
intuition   say   the   answer   is? 
Remember,   when   we   worked   out   the   present   value   of   Rs.75,000,000/-   at  
a   9%   discount   rate   for   15   years,   the   answer   was   20,590,353.   Now,   we  
zerodha.com/varsity    
27    

28    
are   trying   to   do   the   exact   opposite   i.e   compound   20,590,353   at   9%   for  
15   years.   So   the   answer   has   to   be   75,000,000.   When   you   do   this   math   -   
=   20,590,353   *   (1+9%)^(15)   
=    75,000,000    
This   is   the   future   value   of   money.   
So   in   simple   terms,   if   you   had   an   option   to   receive   75,000,000   after   15  
years   or   20,590,353   today,   then   essentially   both   of   these   are   the   same  
deal.   
3.4   -   The   offer   
We   started   this   chapter   with   a   hypothetical   situation.   Your   generous  
friend   gives   you   two   options   -   
Option   A    -   He   gives   you   Rs.10,000/-   right   away    
Option   B    -   He   promises   to   give   your   Rs.10,000/-   exactly   two   year   from  
now    
Chances   are   that   you   selected   option   B.   However,   can   we   tackle   this  
situation   better?   Now   that   we   know   the   concept   of   the   time   value   of  
money   aka   the   present   and   future   value   of   money?   Of   course,   we   can.   
The   problem   here   is   that   we   are   trying   to   compare   the   value   of  
Rs.10,000/-   today   versus   Rs.10,000/-   two   years   from   now.   
Now,   if   we   were   to   opt   for   option   A,   we   will   have   an   option   to   invest   this  
money   in   an   interest-bearing   instrument   and   grow   this   money.   As   of  
today,   a   two   year   fixed   deposit   will   yield   anywhere   close   to   7.5%.   Given  
this,   we   now   have   to   find   out   the   future   value   of   Rs.10,000/-   at   7.5%  
opportunity   rate   (or   the   compounding   rate).   
zerodha.com/varsity    
28    

29    
=   10000*(1+7.5%)^(2) 
=    Rs.11,556.25/-    
This   also   means,   that   if   we   were   to   accept   option   B,   we   would   be  
essentially   accepting   a   value   much   lesser   than   Rs.10,000/-.   A   fair   deal  
here   would   be   either   Rs.10,000/-   today   or   Rs.11,556.25/-   two   years   from  
now!   
This   also   leads   us   to   one   of   the   most   important   conclusions   in   finance   -  
Money   today   is   far   valuable   than   money   tomorrow   because   today   we  
have   an   option   to   invest   this   money   and   grow   it   at   a   risk-free   rate.   
3.5   -   Real-life   applications    
So   before   we   wrap   up   this   chapter,   let   us   consider   a   few   real-life   (like)  
situations   and   apply   the   concept   of   Future   Value   (FV)   and   Present   Value  
(PV)   of   money.   These   are   just   made-up   situations,   you   will   appreciate  
the   application   of   FV   and   PV   better   later   in   this   module   when   the  
example   will   be   probably   more   tangible.   
Question    -   So   assume   you   are   saving   for   your   daughter's   education   at  
a   foreign   university.   She   is   ten   years   today,   and   she   is   expected   to   go   to  
the   US   when   she   is   25   years   old,   which   is   15   years   away.   The   tuition  
fees   including   the   cost   of   living   are   expected   to   be   roughly  
Rs.6,500,000/-.   Given   this,   how   much   should   you   have   today?    
Answer    -   When   you   have   a   situation   like   this,   the   first   thing   to   do   is   to  
figure   out   if   this   is   a   present   value   or   a   future   value   situation.   This   may  
not   be   very   obvious   at   the   surface,   so   this   needs   a   bit   more  
understanding.   One   easy   way   to   figure   that   out   is   by   analyzing   the  
numbers.    
zerodha.com/varsity

30    
We   know   the   cost   of   education   in   15   years   will   be   Rs.6,500,000/-,   so  
what   is   clear   at   this   point   is   the   future   value   of   our   cash   requirement.   
Given   this,   we   need   to   figure   out   the   present   value   of   this   cash  
requirement,   so   that   we   can   save   an   appropriate   amount   today.   We   can  
do   this   by   the   simple   present   value   formula   we   just   learned   -   
Present   value   =   Future   value   /   (1+   discount   rate   )   ^   (time)    
The   7.5%,   15   year   Government   bond   is   a   good   proxy   for   the   discount  
rate,   so   we   will   use   the   same.   
Present   value   =   6,500,000/(1+7.5%)^(15)   
=    Rs.21,96,779/-    
So   in   today's   rate,   if   we   can   manage   to   deposit   a   sum   of   Rs.21,96,779/-,  
we   will   have   the   required   target   funds   in   15   years.   
Of   course,   some   of   you   reading   this   may   be   in   an   exact   situation  
wherein   you'd   be   saving   for   your   child's   future   education.   Do   note,   this   is  
not   the   only   way   to   save   for   it.   The   different   ways   to   accumulate   that  
corpus   is   the   objective   of   this   module,   but   for   now,   we   are   only  
concerned   about   gaining   clarity   about   the   concept   of   the   present   value  
of   money.   
Let   us   take   up   an   example   of   the   future   value   of   money   before   we   wrap  
this   chapter   up.   Here   is   a   situation   you   may   be   familiar   -   
Question    -   Your   dad's   close   friend   at   the   office   also   doubles   up   as   a  
wheeler-dealer,   and   never   hesitates   to   offer   a   financial   deal/scheme.   He  
comes   home   for   a   cup   of   tea   and   also   decides   to   sell   a   financial   product  
to   the   family.   He   says   you   need   to   invest   a   lumpsum   amount   of  
zerodha.com/varsity    
30    

31    
Rs.200,000/-   today   and   in   15   years,   the   family   will   get   a   gain   of  
Rs.450,000/-.    
So   will   you   take   up   this   deal   and   invest   in   it?   
Answer    -   This   is   a   tricky   question   because   this   can   be   solved   by   the  
application   of   both   future   value   and   present   value   concept.   We   will   stick  
to   the   future   value   application.   Quite   straightforward   this   one   -    
Investment   required   today   -   Rs.200,000/-   
Expected   value   from   this   investment   -   Rs.450,000/-   
Given   this,   and   the   7.5%   opportunity   cost,   we   need   to   figure   if   this  
investment   makes   sense.   We   will   extrapolate   Rs.200,000/-   at   the  
opportunity   cost   to   figure   this.   
Future   value   =   200000*(1+7.5%)^15   
=    Rs.   591,775.5    
Contrast   this   with   the   Rs.450,000/-,   and   the   deal   falls   apart.   You'll   have  
to   politely   ask   your   dad's   friend   to   enjoy   his   cup   of   tea   and   leave.   
Now,   here   is   something   for   you   to   think   about   -   how   will   you   solve   the  
above   problem   by   applying   the   concept   of   the   present   value   of   money?   
Think   about   it   and   leave   your   comments   below.   

Key   takeaways   from   this   chapter    
● Money   today   is   always   more   valuable   than   money  
tomorrow   because   money   today   can   be   invested   in  
interest-bearing   instruments   
● The   time   value   of   money   is   a   core   concept   of   personal  
finance   
● Time   value   includes   the   present   value   and   the   future   value  
of   money   
● The   present   value   of   money   helps   us   figure   the   value   of   a  
future   sum   in   today's   terms   
● Present   value   =   Future   value   /   (1+   discount   rate   )   ^   (time)   
● The   discount   rate   =   opportunity   cost   +   risk   premium   
● Give   a   certain   amount   of   money   today,   the   future   value   of  
money   helps   us   figure   out   its   value   at   a   future   date   
● Future   value   of   money   and   the   compound   interest   concept  
works   the   same   way   
● Future   value   =   P*(1+R)^(n)   
● R   in   the   above   formula   is   the   opportunity   cost,   whereas  
the   R   used   in   compound   interest   is   the   growth   rate.   This   is  
the   only   difference   between   Future   value   and   compound  
interest.   

CHAPTER    4  
The   retirement   problem   (Part   1)   
 
4.1   -   Defining   the   problem   
If   you   think   about   it,   success   in   personal   finance   boils   down   to   three   things   -   
Your   ability   to   see   through   the   numbers   
Your   risk-taking   ability,   and   
Common   sense   
I   hope   that   the   previous   two   chapters   have   laid   down   a   foundation,   which   will  
help   you   look   through   the   numbers.   
The   risk-taking   ability   is   merely   a   function   of   your   knowledge   and   the   way   you 
continuously   expand   it.   The   more   you   read   and   understand,   the   more   you   get  
familiar   with   risk   and   the   better   equipped   you   are   to   handle   risk.   The   extent  
of   risk   you   assume   can   make   or   break   your   financial   fortunes.   Of   course,   we  
will   discuss   more   as   we   proceed   through   this   module.   
Common   sense   is   something   applicable   to   all   aspect   of   life   and   not   just  
finance;   we   will   leave   it   at   that   
🙂
   
So,   given   these   three   key   points,   we   will   now   steer   our   way   into   learning   the  
vast   set   of   things   that   make   up   personal   finance,   and   hopefully,   this   will   help  
us   develop   our   instincts   on   all   the   three   counts   required   for   success   in  
personal   finance.   

Finding   a   starting   point   to   start   this   journey   is   a   challenge   given   that   the  
vastness   of   this   topic.   Hence,   in   my   opinion,   the   best   way   to   proceed   is   by  
identifying   a   real-life   financial   problem   and   then   finding   a   solution   for   it.   
The   process   of   finding   the   solution   will   open   up   many   diﬀerent   learning  
windows,   which   will   help   us   understand   the   core   concepts   of   personal  
finance.   
So   let's   get   started.   
I'm   assuming   most   of   you   would   be   in   diﬀerent   stages   of   your   working   life,  
some   would   be   starting   (or   about   to   begin   your   careers),   some   may   be   few  
years   into   work   life,   and   others   probably   halfway   through   your   work   life.   
Regardless   of   where   you   are,   one   of   the   common   goals   in   life   is   to   ensure   that  
you   retire   into   a   happy   and   content   life.   The   fact   that   you   have   retired   should  
not   stop   you   from   leading   a   particular   desired   lifestyle.   You   should   continue  
to   lead   a   lifestyle   that   you   think   you   deserve.   
If   the   above   is   true,   then   it   implies   that   you   need   the   same   amount   of  
disposable   income,   as   you   would   have   when   while   you   were   working.   Lesser  
disposable   income   wants   a   compromised   post-retirement   lifestyle,   which  
none   of   us   wants.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
34    

35    
 
Let   us   put   this   in   context   and   assign   numbers   to   it,   and   elaborate   this   a   bit  
further.   
Assume   you   will   work   for   the   next   25   years   (these   are   your   income-generating  
years),   post   which   you   will   retire.   Aer   you   retire,   you   expect   to   live   for   say   20  
more   years.   Assume,   the   cash   required   today   to   lead   your   lifestyle   is  
Rs.50,000/-   per   month.   This   is   cash   post   taxes,   fixed   expenses,   utility   bills,   etc.  
This   is   your   disposable   income   per   month.   
The   idea   is   that   aer   25   years,   for   the   next   20   years   of   your   post-retirement  
life,   you'll   need   the   same   Rs.50,000/-   every   month,   this   is   about   Rs.600,000/-  
per   year.   

36    
Some   of   you   may   disagree   or   may   have   a   diﬀerent   opinion   on   how   much   you  
need   post-retirement;   I   understand   that   but   stick   with   for   now,   please.   
Let   me   put   this   tabular   format   for   you   to   understand   this   better   -   
 
I'm   sure   all   of   you   reading   would   agree   that   this   is   a   real-life   problem   and   we  
all   need   to   address   this.   
If   you   think   about   this,   there   are   two   parts   to   this   real-life   problem   -   
How   much   retirement   corpus   one   needs   to   have   accumulated   by   the   time   of  
retirement,   i.e.   the   beginning   of   the   year   2044?   
How   does   one   accumulate   the   required   money?   
Some   of   you   may   be   tempted   to   answer   the   first   part   straight   away   -   

It   is   Rs.600,000/-   per   year   (50,000   per   month   for   12   months)   and   for   20   year   it  
is   Rs.12,000,000/-   (600,000   *   20)   or   1.2Cr.   So   if   we   were   to   accumulate   a  
retirement   corpus   of   1.2Cr   by   the   year   2044,   we   could   easily   sail   through   the  
next   20   years   of   post-retirement   life   by   burning   Rs.50,000/-   per   month,   all   the  
way   to   2063.   
Well,   if   only   life   was   that   simple   J   
Given   the   above,   the   question   is,   how   much   cash   reserves   you'd   need   at   the  
end   of   25   years,   i.e.   in   the   year   2044,   such   that   you   can   have   Rs.50,000/-   every  
month   till   the   year   2064.   
In   this   chapter,   we   will   address   the   required   corpus   bit   and   figure   out   the  
amount   needed   at   the   start   of   the   retirement   year.   In   the   next   section,   we   will 
figure   out   how   this   corpus   gets   generated.   
4.2   -   Inflation   and   other   realities   of   life   
In   the   absence   of   inflation,   the   math   above   would   work   like   a   charm,   i.e.   in  
the   year   2044,   a   sum   of   Rs.12,000,000/-   would   help   us   sail   through   our  
retirement   years   at   ease,   i.e.   at   the   rate   of   Rs.50,000/-   per   month   up   to   2064.   
However,   inflation   is   real,   and   this   makes   life   complicated   in   multiple   ways.  
Inflation   is   the   phenomenon,   which   makes   things   expensive.   For   example,   a  
plate   of   pav   bhaji   at   a   restaurant   may   cost   Rs.50/-   today,   but   the   same   may  
cost   Rs.55/-   at   the   very   same   restaurant   the   next   year.   This   marginal   increase  
in   cost   is   attributed   to   inflation.   In   other   words,   the   purchasing   power   of  
money   has   reduced   over   one   year.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
37    

38    
This   is   true,   all   else   equal,   money   today   will   always   be   less   valuable   at   a  
future   date.   For   this   same   reason,   all   the   stories   of   our   parents   and  
grandparents   enjoying   a   full   meal   for   less   than   Rs.2/-   exists   J   
This   implies,   today's   Rs.50,000/-   will   not   be   Rs.50,000/-   tomorrow.   It   will  
naturally   reduce   owing   to   inflation.   For   this   exact   reason,   we   cannot   only  
multiply   the   amount   required   with   the   number   of   years   and   arrive   at   a   figure.   
4.3   -   The   Future   value   
To   find   a   solution,   we   need   to   find   out   the   Rs.50,000/-   equivalent   25   years  
from   now.   This   is   what   we   learned   in   the   previous   chapter.   
The   expected   cash   requirement   is   as   shown   below   -   

The   table   is   quite   easy   to   understand.   Look   at   the   first   row,   it   says,   the   1 
st 
 
retirement   year   is   2044,   and   it   is   25   years   from   the   current   year   i.e.2019.   The  
corpus   required   for   2044   is   Rs.600,000/-.   This   is   a   constant   amount   needed   for  
all   the   retirement   years.   
The   2nd   retirement   year   is   2045,   which   is   26   years   away   from   the   current   year  
(2019).   So   on   and   so   forth.   

Now   the   task   at   hand   is   to   estimate   the   value   of   Rs.600,000/-   25   years   later,   26  
years   later,   27   years   later,   and   for   each   year   up   to   the   final   year,   given   a   certain  
level   of   inflation.   Remember,   these   are   all   the   future   value   of   money.   
4.4   -   Estimating   the   future   value   of   the   corpus   
To   proceed   further   from   this   point   and   estimate   the   corpus   required   at   the  
start   of   the   retirement   year,   i.e.   2044,   we   need   to   have   a   view   on   the   long-term  
inflation.   
I   would   be   comfortable   pegging   the   long-term   average   inflation   value  
between   4-5%.   Now,   the   question   to   answer   is   -   given   5%   inflation,   what  
would   be   the   value   of   Rs.600,000/-   25   years   from   now.   
Similarly,   given   5%   inflation,   what   would   be   the   value   of   Rs.600,000/-,   26  
years   from   now,   so   on   and   so   forth,   all   the   way   to   the   20   years   of   retirement.   
If   you   recollect   from   the   previous   chapter,   we   are   talking   about   the   future  
value   calculation   here.   Once   we   have   all   the   future   values,   we   need   to   sum  
them   up   to   get   the   total   corpus   required   at   the   start   of   the   retirement   year.   
Let   us   do   this   for   the   initial   2-3   years   and   then   take   the   help   of   MS   Excel   to  
figure   the   rest.   
From   the   previous   chapter,   the   future   value   formula   is   -   
Future   value   =     P*(1+R)^(n)    
Where,   
P=   Principal   i.e.   Rs.600,000/-   
R   =   opportunity   cost,   in   this   context   it   is   the   inflation   rate,   so   5%   
zerodha.com/varsity    
40    

41    
n   =   Period,   25   in   this   case   
Plugging   in   these   value   -   
600,000*(1+5%)^(25)   
=   Rs.2,031,813/-   
So,   in   25   years,   if   you   have   Rs.2,031,813/-,   then   it   is   as   good   as   having  
Rs.600,000/-   today.   
For   the   2 
nd  
  year   -   
600,000*(1+5%)^(26)   
=   Rs.2,133,404/-   
So,   in   26   years,   if   you   have   Rs.2,133,404/-,   then   it   is   as   good   as   having  
Rs.600,000/-   today.   
So   on   and   so   forth.   
Here   is   an   excel   snapshot   that   shows   how   the   numbers   stack   up   for   all   the  
other   years,   but   before   you   look   at   it,   can   you   guess   how   much   this   amount  
can   be?   
For   most   people   I've   asked   this   question,   they   get   the   value   way   oﬀ   the   mark,  
this   is   because   they   cannot   comprehend   the   fact   there   is   inflation   and  
compounding   (future   value)   at   play   here.   
So   go   ahead   and   give   it   a   shot,   take   a   guess   on   how   much   the   retirement  
corpus   should   be,   once   you've   answered   this,   then   take   a   look   at   the   actual  
number;   hopefully,   it   should   match,   if   not,   don't   worry,   we   all   have   some  
learning   to   do.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
41    

42    
 
As   you   can   see,   the   corpus   required   at   the   start   of   the   retirement   year   is   a  
staggering   7.2Crs!   
The   numbers   drastically   change   if   we   change   the   inflation   assumption   and   of  
course   the   actual   amount   of   our   lifestyle   demands.   
4.5   -   Oversimplification   
Some   of   the   things   are   oversimplified   and   exaggerated   here.   For   instance,  
having   a   constant   monthly   requirement   of   50k   may   not   be   accurate.   As   we  
age,   we   would   prefer   to   sit   at   home   and   sip   a   drink   as   opposed   to   hanging   out  
in   the   coolest   and   trendiest   bar   in   town.   Or   we   may   cut   down   on   all   the  
outside   eating,   watching   movies,   etc.   We   may   not   want   to   buy   the   latest  
denim   from   levis   or   the   newest   pair   of   sneakers   from   Nike.   Who   knows?   
zerodha.com/varsity

43    
Our   requirements   could   be   very   diﬀerent,   and   from   whatever   I've   read,  
observed,   and   understood,   the   money   required   for   older   people   is   lesser   than  
the   younger   ones.   So   we   may   not   need   50K   per   month   when   we   retire.   
But   here   is   the   thing   with   personal   finance,   it   is   best   to   take   a   conservative  
approach   and   figure   out   the   outcome.   If   we   manage   to   lead   a   comfortable   but  
yet   a   frugal   life   at   a   later   point,   its   great,   else   we   would   have   anyway  
budgeted   for   it.   
In   the   next   chapter,   we   will   understand   ways   to   generate   this   income.   

Key   takeaways   from   this   chapter    
● Retirement   is   a   real-life   financial   problem   that   we   all   need   to  
address 
● Inflation   complicates   things.   Money   today   is   not   the   same  
tomorrow   
● The   inflation   diminishes   the   purchasing   power   of   money   
● Use   the   future   value   of   money   to   estimate   the   worth   of   money  
today,   'n',   many   years   later.   

CHAPTER    5   
The   retirement   problem   (Part   2)   
 
5.1   -   Assumptions   
We   are   at   an   exciting   point   now.   The   previous   chapter   helped   us   estimate  
(roughly)   the   corpus   required   for   one   to   retire   comfortably,   without  
drastically   changing   the   post-retirement   lifestyle.   
One   can   argue   that   certain   aspects   were   overlooked   while   estimating   the  
post-retirement   corpus,   which   is   ok   for   now   because   this   helps   us   determine  
the   retirement   corpus   on   a   conservative   basis.   
The   idea,   of   course,   is   to   understand   personal   finance   so   well   that   we   can  
plugin   things   as   we   progress   and   eventually   get   the   corpus   number   right.   
In   the   previous   chapter,   we   figured   that   we   need   roughly   7Cr   by   retirement;   in  
this   chapter,   we   address   the   technique   to   generate   the   same.   It   must   be   quite  
evident   to   you   by   now   that   to   create   the   retirement   corpus   by   the   target  
retirement   year;   we   need   to   make   investments   starting   today.   
The   investments   that   we   make   today   should   ideally   spread   across   multiple  
assets.   This   is   called   the   multi-asset   portfolio,   which   includes   -   fixed   deposits,  
gold,   real   estate,   equities,   cash,   and   cash   equivalents.   The   overall   growth   that  
you   experience   will   then   be   an   aggregate   across   all   these   assets.   
zerodha.com/varsity

45    
 
Let   me   explain   a   bit   more   before   we   get   back   to   the   retirement   problem.  
Assume   your   net   worth   is   distributed   across   multiple   assets   -   
30%   of   your   net   worth   is   invested   in   real   estate   
8%   of   your   net   worth   is   in   the   fixed   deposit   
8%   of   your   net   worth   is   from   gold   
13%   of   your   net   worth   is   in   equities   
Cash   is   4%   
The   numbers   assigned   are   all   arbitrary,   to   drive   the   concept,   so   don't   sweat  
over   it   
🙂
   
Now,   each   of   these   assets   grows   at   a   specific   rate.   Needless   to   say   that   the  
growth   rates   diﬀer   for   each   of   these   assets.   The   question   is,   what   is   the  
overall   growth   given   this   portfolio   of   assets?   
To   answer   this,   we   need   to   have   an   expected   growth   rate   for   each   of   these  
assets.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
45    

46    
My   long   term   (10   plus   years)   growth   expectation   (CAGR)   from   these   assets   are 
as   follows   -   
Real   estate   -   8-10%   
Fixed   Deposit   -   6-7%   
Gold   -   8-9%   
Equities   -   10-11%   
Cash   -   0%   (in   fact   cash   de   grows   if   you   consider   inflation)   
You   can   develop   your   own   opinion   on   the   growth   rates   for   these   assets   by  
looking   at   the   long-term   trends   and   by   developing   an   idea   on   their   future  
performance.   But   here   is   an   advise,   when   you   work   with  
predictions/projections   of   any   sort   in   personal   finance,   always   keep   the  
number   on   a   conservative   basis.   
For   example,   frankly,   I   know   equities,   in   the   long   run,   will   do   much   better  
than   11%   CAGR,   but   I'll   work   with   a   10-11%   range.   The   advantage   here   is   that  
you   build   a   future   based   on   conservative   assumption,   anything   better   is   only  
a   bonus.   
Anyway,   the   overall   portfolio   growth   in   the   sum   product   of   the   weight   of   each  
asset   and   the   expected   return.   Therefore   -   
=   30%   *   10%   +   8%   *   7%   +   8%   *   9%   +   13%   *   11%   +   4%*   0   
=    8.3%    
So   as   you   can   see,   the   combined   (diversified)   portfolio   with   multi-assets,  
generates   an   overall   return   of   8.3%.   
zerodha.com/varsity

Of   course,   change   in   asset   allocation   has   an   impact   on   portfolio   growth.   We  
have   discussed   this   multiple   times,   won't   get   into   that   discussion   now.   
By   the   way,   check   this   to   know   how   people   generally   divide   their   net   worth  
across   a   diverse   set   of   assets   -   
 
The   infographic   above   mainly   talks   about   the   HNI   and   above   category;  
however,   if   you   walk   into   any   financial   planning   firm,   you   are   likely   to   get   a  
somewhat   similar   diversification   plan.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
47    

48    
While   a   multi-asset   portfolio   is   highly   desirable,   we   won't   get   into   that  
discussion   just   yet.   This   is   slightly   complex,   and   we   are   too   early   in   this  
module   to   talk   about   it.   
For   the   retirement   problem,   we   will   make   one   fundamental   assumption.   The  
assumption   is   that   we   will   look   at   only   equity   for   building   the   retirement  
corpus.   The   exposure   to   equity   is   in   the   form   of   making   systematic  
investments   in   a   growth-oriented   equity   mutual   fund.   
If   you   do   not   understand   'systematic   investments   in   a   growth-oriented   equity 
mutual   fund',   then   do   not   worry.   Going   forward   in   this   module,   we   will  
discuss   this   in   detail.   
Since   equity   is   the   only   asset   we   are   dealing   with   in   this   retirement   problem,  
we   need   to   assign   an   expected   growth   rate   to   this   asset.   I   think   a   10-11%  
CARG   is   a   fair   expectation,   especially   when   the   holding   period   is   long,   i.e.  
more   than   ten   plus   years.   
So   let's   work   with   this   number   for   now.   
5.2   -   The   setup   
A   quick   recap   of   the   retirement   problem,   before   we   proceed.   In   the   previous  
chapter,   we   figured   that   we   need   funds   to   the   tune   of   7Crs   to   lead   a  
comfortable   retired   life.   We   call   this   a   retirement   corpus.   We   defied  
'comfortable'   by   ensuring   we   have   at   least   Rs.50,000/-   per   month   for   the   20  
years   post-retirement.   
The   next   step   is   to   figure   out   how   one   can   generate   a   retirement   corpus.  
Remember,   we   are   starting   our   journey   to   save   for   retirement   today,   and   we  
have   25   years   to   build   this   corpus.   Twenty-five   years   is   300   months.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
48    

49    
For   now,   we   will   rely   upon   investing   in   an   equity   mutual   fund,   in   a   systematic  
way   to   generate   this   retirement   corpus.   To   solve   this   problem,   we   need   to  
make   a   few   assumptions.   They   are   -   
We   have   a   steady   job   which   pays   us   a   salary   every   month   
We   are   employed   until   the   year   of   our   retirement   
Our   primary   savings   vehicle   is   regular   investments   in   equity   mutual   funds   
We   get   yearly   hikes   in   our   pay   
Every   year   we   will   increase   the   investments   in   equity   mutual   funds   by   10%   
The   increase   in   savings   happens   every   January   
I   know   many   of   you   may   be   concerned   with   these   assumptions   here,  
especially   about   the   job   and   the   hikes,   but   then,   that's   an   underlying  
assumption,   without   which   we   cannot   proceed   
🙂
 
So   how   do   these   assumptions   translate   to   action?   Here   is   how   it   looks   -   
 
Let   me   explain   this   table.   The   very   first   row   reads   like   this   -   
zerodha.com/varsity

50    
It   is   January,   and   I'm   making   my   very   first   investment   of   Rs.5000/-   today.   I  
won't   be   touching   this   investment   until   I   retire,   which   is   25   years   away   or  
about   300   months   away.   
The   2 
nd  
  row   reads   similar   -   Its   February,   I'm   making   the   2 
nd  
  savings  
installment   for   the   year,   i.e.   Rs.5000/-.   Retirement   is   now   299   months   away.   
I   want   you   to   recognize   the   fact   that   the   'months   away'   can   be   looked   at   from  
a   diﬀerent   perspective.   If   you   realize,   these   are   the   number   of   months   during  
which   your   money   can   grow.   For   example,   the   very   first   installment   you   make  
has   the   luxury   to   build   (or   compound)   for   300   full   months.   The   next   month's  
savings   can   grow   only   for   299   months,   3 
rd  
  installment   has   only   298   months   to  
grow.   So   on   and   so   forth.   
Now,   the   5 
th  
  and   6 
th  
  assumptions   state   that   we   are   increasing   the   savings   rate  
by   10%   every   January.   This   means,   if   we   are   starting   with   Rs.5000/-   for   year   1,  
the   2 
nd  
  year   we   bump   this   up   by   10%,   hence   for   the   2 
nd  
  year   we   invest  
Rs.5,500/-.   
This   is   how   it   looks   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
50    

51    
 
The   month   counting   continues   the   same   way.   For   example,   the   Rs.5,500/- 
investment   we   make   in   the   2 
nd  
  year   January   has   only   288   months   to   grow   or  
compound.   
I   hope   you   get   this   flow   for   now.   
So   what   happens   aer   you   make   these   investments?   Well,   as   per   the  
assumption,   each   of   these   monthly   investments   we   make,   grows   at   11%  
CAGR   (compounded   annual   growth   rate),   for   the   respective   months.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
51    

52    
For   example,   the   very   first   investment   that   we   make,   i.e.   Rs.5000/-   gets   to  
grow   at   the   rate   of   11%,   for   300   months.   So   what   would   be   the   value   of   this  
investment   at   the   end   of   300   months?   
Well,   by   now,   you   should   recognize   that   we   can   apply   the   concept   of   the  
future   value   of   money   and   get   the   answer.   The   future   value   of   money   formula  
is   -   
Future   value   =     P*(1+R)^(n)    
Where,   
Principal   ( P )   =   Rs.5000    
Growth   rate   ( R )   =   11%   per   annum    
Time   ( n )   =   300   months.   However,   this   formula   considers   time   in   years.   Hence  
we   need   to   express   300   months   in   years,   therefore   300/12   =   25    
=   5000*(1+11%)^(300/12)   
=Rs.67,927/-    
Let   us   do   this   for   the   2 
nd  
  installment   as   well;   everything   stays   the   same   except  
for   the   time   component   -   
=   5000*(1+11%)^(299/12)   
= Rs.67,339/-    
This   is   how   the   table   looks   -   

53    
 
Now,   if   you   add   up   all   the   future   values,   you   get   the   corpus   accumulated   for  
your   retirement.   Before   I   show   you   the   number,   what   is   your   guess?   Does  
Rs.5000/-   as   the   starting   amount   make   the   cut?   Do   you   think   it   gives   you   the  
target   corpus   of   Rs.7Crs?   
If   you   are   doubtful,   then   you   are   right.   It   does   not   cut   the   mark.   It's   way   oﬀ  
the   mark   -   
 
 
zerodha.com/varsity    
53    

54    
So   what   should   we   do?   How   do   we   ensure   we   reach   the   target   retirement  
corpus?   Well,   we   can   do   three   things   -   
We   save   for   a   much   longer   period,   say   30   or   35   years.   However,   this   may   not  
be   viable   as   we   won't   have   a   sustainable   source   of   income   for   these   many  
years   
Increase   the   rate   of   return,   maybe   from   11%   to   14%,   but   then   is   like   robbing  
yourself   of   your   future.   So   we   won't   commit   this   sin   
Increase   savings,   this   means   a   frugal   life   today   for   a   comfortable   and  
financially   independent   life   tomorrow.   This   is   an   option   we   can   work   with  
this.   
So   from   saving   Rs.5000   per   month,   let   us   bump   this   up   to   say   Rs.15,000/-   per  
month.   Here   is   how   the   numbers   stack   up   -   
 
There   is   a   significant   improvement,   but   still   not   close   to   the   7Cr   mark.   We   can  
try   this   with   Rs.20,000/-   
zerodha.com/varsity    
54    

55    
 
As   you   can   see,   starting   at   Rs.20,000/-   per   month,   we   get   close   to   the   7   Cr  
mark,   which   upon   retirement   will   yield   us   Rs.50,000/-   per   month   for   20   years.   
5.3   -   Are   you   serious?   
Saving   Rs.20,000/-   a   month,   that   too   as   a   starting   amount   may   sound   crazy   to  
many,   especially   for   people   who   are   just   starting   their   careers.   Aer   all,  
you've   just   started   your   career,   started   seeing   a   steady   cash   flow,   and   you   are  
expected   to   park   the   bulk   of   it   for   retirement?   
How   fair   is   that?   
Before   it   demotivates   you   any   further,   let   me   tell   you.   It   is   not   all   that   lousy  
🙂
   
Let   me   make   an   assumption   here;   if   you   are   starting   your   career   now,   then  
probably   you   are   24   or   25   years   old.   This   means   you   have   a   long   runway  
before   you   retire.   Even   if   you   retire   by   60,   you   mostly   have   35   years   to   retire.   
Out   of   these   35   years   of   service,   even   if   you   invest   for   30   years,   you   will   be  
placed   much   better.   You   can   choose   to   start   with   Rs.10,000/-   per   month.  

 
Starting   your   career   early,   gives   you   two   powerful   levers   to   operate   -   time  
and   money.   You   can   start   with   a   small   amount   and   build   on   it,   eventually,   it  
will   yield   you   a   similar   result.   
What   if   you   are   in   the   middle   of   your   career   and   you   are   looking   at   retirement  
sometime   over   the   next   10   or   15   years?   Well,   unfortunately,   you   do   not   have  
many   options   expect   to   save   large   chunks   of   your   cash   flow.   
But   remember,   this   entire   conversation   is   an   oversimplification   to   help   us   get  
started.   There   are   many   angles   to   this   story.   For   example,   you   may   acquire  
property   by   inheritance,   which   earns   you   a   rental   income   for   the   rest   of   your  
life   or   you   can   get   a   huge   lump   sum   amount   at   retirement,   thanks   to   PF   and  
stuﬀ.   This   retirement   amount   gets   parked   in   a   savings   account   or   a   fixed  
deposit,   which   gives   you   yearly   cash   flow.   
The   objective   of   this   module   is   to   help   you   solve   this   puzzle   so   that   you   can  
plan   your   financials   eﬀiciently   for   yourself   and   your   family. 
5.4   -Next   step   
Irrespective   of   the   lump   sum   cash   or   a   yielding   rental   property   landing   up   in  
your   lap   by   retirement,   investing   in   equity   is   something   that   you   cannot   miss.  
zerodha.com/varsity    
56    

57    
I   firmly   believe   that   'equity'   as   an   asset   class   will   outperform   all   other   assets  
and   shine   through.   Equity   has   to   be   a   part   of   your   long   term   portfolio.   
The   best   way   to   gain   exposure   to   equity   is   by   investing   in   mutual   funds   via   a  
systematic   investment   plan.   Of   course,   there   are   many   other   variants   and  
techniques   for   this.   
Given   this,   over   the   next   few   chapters,   we   will   deep   dive   into   mutual   funds  
and   get   a   thorough   understanding   of   mutual   fund   investing.   This   discussion  
will   include   things   like   developing   a   mindset   for   mutual   fund   investment,  
building   a   mutual   fund   portfolio,   goal-based   portfolio,   fund   analysis,   direct   vs  
regular,   growth   vs   dividends,   etc.   
Once   we   understand   mutual   funds,   we   will   steer   our   way   to   learn   other  
critical   components   of   personal   finance   such   as   life   insurance,   health  
insurance,   pension   funds,   EPF,   ETFs   etc.   
So   as   you   can   imagine,   we   have   a   long   learning   path   ahead   
🙂

CHAPTER    6   
Introduction   to   Mutual   Funds   
 
6.1   -   Flashback   
The   retirement   problem   chapter   has   laid   down   a   learning   path   to   understand  
personal   finance.   We   know   now   that   to   build   a   retirement   corpus,   long-term  
investments   in   mutual   funds   is   inevitable.   Given   the   pivotal   role   mutual   funds  
plays   in   defining   our   financial   welfare,   it   is   completely   justified   to   spend   some  
time   to   learn   about   mutual   funds.   The   learning   that   I'm   talking   about   is  
something   that   goes   beyond   normal   mutual   fund   investors   would   know.   The  
objective   here   is   to   help   you   know   the   basics   plus   a   little   more.   Hence,   the  
topics   I'd   like   to   cover   here   are   -   
What   is   a   mutual   fund?   

Regulatory   aspects   around   a   mutual   fund   from   an   MF   investor's   perspective   
The   diﬀerent   types   of   mutual   funds   -   Equity,   Debt,   FoF,   Hybrid,   Liquid   
How   to   analyze   a   mutual   fund?   -   Risk,   return,   ratios,   exposure   
Factors   that   matter   -   MF   ranking,   Direct   vs   Regular,   Growth   vs   Dividend   

Of   course,   I   will   add   more   topics   if   there   is   a   need   for   it.   
Given   this,   let   us   get   started   on   the   very   first   topic   i.e.   to   understand   what   a  
"mutual   fund"   really   means.   
I'm   making   an   assumption   here   that   you   know   nothing   about   mutual   funds.  
I'm   assuming   that   this   is   your   very   first   attempt   to   learn   about   mutual   funds,  
hence   we   are   starting   from   scratch.   You   can   skip   this   chapter   if   you   know  
what   a   mutual   fund   is.   
Before   we   start   learning   about   Mutual   funds,   I'd   like   to   digress   a   bit   and  
narrate   a   personal   story   dating   back   to   2008-09.   
I'm   not   sure   how   many   of   you   reading   this   were   trading,   investing,   tracking   or  
remotely   connected   to   the   stock   markets   in   the   year   2008.   The   year   2008   was  
very   interesting   (perhaps   scary)   for   people   sitting   on   the   sidelines   and  
watching   all   the   action,   but   for   people   involved   and   had   their   livelihoods   tied  
to   the   market,   2008   was   apocalyptic.   The   financial   services   industry   was   in  
absolute   pits,   and   I   was   in   the   city   of   London,   which   was   the   epicentre   of   the  
financial   meltdown.   I   was   relatively   new   in   the   industry,   had   very   few   industry  
connections,   and   hardly   any   working   experience   in   the   UK.   When   the  
industry-wide   job   cuts   started,   I   knew   it   would   be   me   sooner   or   later.   The  
good   thing   was   I   just   dint   sit   on   the   sideline   wondering   if   I   would   get   the  
layoﬀ   notice.   I   knew   it   was   a   matter   of   time.   
Given   the   situation,   I   had   decided   to   head   back   to   India.   Of   course,   not   that  
there   many   options   for   me   to   choose.   
By   Feb   2009,   I   was   back   in   Bangalore,   luckily   I   found   myself   a   spot   to   sit   and  
trade   the   markets   with   the   (now)   legendary   Kamath   Associates   (pre-Zerodha  
zerodha.com/varsity    
59    

60    
days).   Soon,   I   was   in   the   thick   of   the   action   and   I   was   trading   anything   and  
everything   that   moved   on   the   Indian   exchanges.   
The   capital   to   trade   was   mainly   my   own   plus   a   bit   from   my   close   circle.   
While   trading   was   something   I   enjoyed,   I   found   investing   super   interesting.   I  
spent   a   lot   of   time   reading   the   annual   reports   and   understanding   of  
businesses.   This   eﬀort   included   learning   a   bit   of   accounting   to   help   me   read  
the   company's   financial   statements.   I   soon   realized   that   stock   picking   and  
building   long-term   equity   portfolio   was   something   that   I   wanted   to   for   a  
living.   
I   slowly   branched   out   from   active   trading   and   started   building   an   investing  
practice.   I   moved   out   of   Kamath   Associates   to   do   this   full   time.   Of   course,   at  
that   point,   Kamath   Associates   dissolved   and   Nithin   Kamath   started   Zerodha.   
Over   time   I   built   a   carefully   craed   equity   portfolio   for   myself.   I   had   a   thesis  
for   each   investment   made.   I   was   aware   of   the   growth   drivers   and   the   risk  
parameters   for   each   stock   I   had   invested.   
While   I   started   doing   this   for   myself,   I   soon   extended   my   help   in   setting   up   an  
equity   portfolio   for   my   family   members   and   later   to   my   close   friends.   I   had  
few   things   going   right   for   me   and   soon   people   around   me   and   their  
immediate   circle   knew   I   was   a   good   option   to   consider   for   equity   investing.   It  
was   in   November   2010,   that   I   decided   to   do   this   as   a   profession.   
My   idea   was   to   help   people   build   an   equity   portfolio,   manage   it   on   their  
behalf,   grow   it,   review   it   periodically,   assess   the   risk,   and   do   everything  
possible   with   a   single   point   agenda   -   to   help   them   generate   wealth   over   a  
long   period.   

In   short,   I   wanted   to   be   a   'Fund   Manager',   help   people   build   wealth   by 
investing   their   money   in   the   stock   market.   
I   continued   my   journey,   by   2012,   I   was   fortunate   enough   to   onboard   a   bunch  
of   clients   and   managed   a   decent   sum   of   money.   I   was   taking   an   independent  
decision   on   which   stock   to   invest   in   and   which   stocks   to   exit.   I   was   deciding 
how   much   to   invest   in   each   stock   and   for   how   long.   On   the   first   Saturday   of  
every   month,   I'd   send   a   report   to   all   my   clients   informing   them   of   how   their  
portfolio   was   performing   in   the   market.   
I   was   indeed   a   fund   manager   for   at   least   20-25   families,   and   I   felt   happy   and  
responsible   being   in   that   position.   
 
However,   there   was   a   problem   lurking.   As   per   the   regulators,   i.e.   SEBI,   anyone  
aspiring   to   be   a   fund   manager   and   manage   portfolios,   had   to   procure   a  
license   from   SEBI.   This   license   is   called   the   'Portfolio   Management   Service'  
(PMS)   license.   Probably   I'll   discuss   PMS   later   in   the   module.   Given   my  
situation,   the   cost   of   applying   for   this   license   and   the   associated   net   worth  
zerodha.com/varsity    
61    

62    
requirements   was   prohibitive.   Hence,   I   was   forced   to   shut   shop   in   the  
subsequent   years   and   return   the   investment   capital   to   the   clients.   
Anyway,   thanks   for   reading   through   my   rather   boring   flashback,   but   I   had   a  
reason   to   share   this   with   you.   I   want   you   to   identify   a   few   things.   As   a  
self-proclaimed   fund   manager,   I   was   trying   to   -   
1. Researching   stocks   
2. Build   an   investment   thesis   for   each   stock   
3. Estimate   the   amount   of   money   to   invest   in   each   stock   
4. Build   an   equity   portfolio   
5. Track   individual   stock   and   overall   portfolio   
6. Measure   the   returns,   performance,   and   risk   at   periodical   intervals   
7. Report   to   clients   
The   points   mentioned   above   captures   the   role   of   a   typical   fund   manager.   At  
this   point,   I   want   you   to   be   very   clear   about   the   role   of   a   fund   manager.   
Also,   a   quick   reminder   -   we   are   in   the   process   of   understanding   what   'mutual  
funds',   means   and   I   hope   I'm   heading   in   the   right   direction,   so   please   do   stay  
with   me   on   this   
🙂
   
6.2   -   Large   scale   fund   manager   
I   guess   most   of   us   at   some   point   would   have   paid   a   visit   to   the   neighborhood  
bakery   to   buy   either   a   loaf   of   bread   or   a   pack   of   biscuit   baked   by   the   baker.  
These   biscuits   usually   have   a   local   and   unique   taste   to   it,   not   available  
elsewhere   in   the   city.   It   is   a   local   thing.   It   is   nearly   impossible   for   a   person   in  
another   city   to   source   the   same   biscuit.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
62    

63    
However,   think   of   the   biscuits   made   by   Britannia,   a   large-scale   biscuit   and  
cookie   manufacturer.   It   does   not   matter   whether   I'm   in   Bangalore   or   Delhi.  
The   same   Britannia   biscuit   is   available   throughout   the   country.   It   tastes   the  
same,   has   the   same   packaging,   looks   identical,   and   weighs   the   same.   Not   a  
grain   of   salt   or   sugar   varies   from   one   pack   to   another.   It   is   a   highly  
standardized   oﬀering.   
Britannia   is   a   large-scale   baker,   with   a   distribution   network   across   the  
country.   The   baker   in   your   neighborhood   is   a   local   baker,   with   the   residents  
as   his   loyal   customers.   He   does   not   have   a   distribution   network   like   Britannia.   
Now   think   about   my   'fund   management'   aﬀair,   I   guess   you   would   agree   that   I  
was   comparable   to   the   local   baker,   catering   to   a   small   set   of   customers   in   the  
neighborhood.   
On   similar   lines,   there   are   "fund   managers",   on   a   large-scale   basis   who   can  
cater   to   millions   of   customers   and   oﬀer   the   same   service   to   each   one   of   these  
customers.   
Customers   in   the   fund   management   context   are   people   who   are   looking   for  
'fund   management',   services.   
These   large-scale   fund   managers   typically   operate   via   a   mutual   fund 
structure.   Think   of   the   mutual   fund   structure   as   a   method   to   oﬀer   fund  
management   at   scale.   I   will   shortly   discuss   this   in   more   detail,   but   before  
that,   let   us   draw   a   quick   analogy   to   reestablish   the   things   we   have   learned   so  
far   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
63    

64    
 
At   this   point,   all   I   want   you   to   understand   is   this   -   
1. A   fund   manager   is   responsible   for   your   funds   
2. An   Asset   Management   Company   (AMC),   is   a   company   where   a   fund  
manager   works   and   manages   your   money   
3. Think   of   the   'Mutual   Fund   structure',   as   a   vehicle   or   mechanism   to  
manage   your   funds   
I   hope   so   far   so   good.   We   will   now   proceed   to   understand   how   a   mutual   fund  
company   is   structured   and   functions.   I   understand   that   you   do   not   need   to  
know   about   this,   as   long   as   you   know   how   to   invest   in   a   mutual   fund.   Fair  
enough,   but   I   have   a   slightly   diﬀerent   objective   here   i.e.   to   make   you   a   little  
more   knowledgeable   than   a   normal   MF   investor.   
It   is   like   this,   you   can   buy   a   DSLR   camera,   turn   on   the   auto   mode   and   start  
clicking   the   pictures.   Chances   are   you   will   end   up   taking   decent   pictures.  
However,   if   you   take   the   eﬀort   of   knowing   a   little   more   about   your   camera,  
you   may   end   up   using   your   camera   more   eﬀiciently,   which   may   perhaps  
result   in   a   brilliant   photograph.   
Therefore,   in   my   opinion,   knowing   a   bit   about   the   structure   of   an   AMC   will   not  
go   waste.   It   is   one   of   those   'good   to   know',   things   in   life

6.3   -   Deconstructing   an   AMC   
Setting   up   an   Asset   Management   Company   (AMC)   is   a   very   daunting   task.   You  
cannot   wake   up   one   day   and   decide   to   start   an   AMC.   There   are   prerequisites  
to   set   up   an   AMC   and   these   prerequisites   are   laid   down   by   'The   Securities   and  
Exchange   Board   of   India'   (SEBI).   SEBI   is   the   governing   authority   for   all   the  
AMCs   in   India.   SEBI   holds   the   rights   to   grant   or   not   grant   the   AMC   license   to   a  
corporate   body.   
The   process   of   setting   up   and   AMC   is   highly   stringent   and   rightfully   so.   Aer  
all,   there   is   a   large   scale   public   money   at   stake   and   the   regulators   need   to  
ensure   this   money   is   managed   by   responsible   entities.   
In   their   eﬀort   to   bring   in   transparency   and   accountability,   SEBI   has   proposed  
a   multi-tier   structure   for   an   AMC.   Here   is   the   structure   of   an   AMC   -   
 
Fund   sponsor    -   Think   of   the   fund   sponsor   as   the   main   promoter   of   the   Asset  
Management   Company.   The   fund   sponsor   is   a   corporate   body,   which  
zerodha.com/varsity    
65    

66    
expresses   a   desire   to   set   up   an   AMC.   The   fund   sponsor   approaches   SEBI   for  
setting   up   the   AMC.   The   fund   sponsor   has   to   follow   the   2   stage   application  
process   by   furnishing   all   the   details   SEBI   would   require.   At   the   end   of   stage   1,  
SEBI   either   denies   the   licenses   or   grants   an   'in   principle',   approval   for   the 
same.    
Once   the   in-principal   approval   is   issued,   SEBI   demands   more   documents   and  
details   for   further   scrutiny.   Finally,   aer   the   stringent   due   diligence   process,  
SEBI   can   again   decide   to   either   grant   or   deny   the   AMC   license   to   the   fund  
sponsor.   
Trustees   -    Once   the   fund   sponsor   procures   the   license   from   SEBI,   they   need  
to   register   a   trust   and   appoint   a   board   of   trustees.   The   trust   ensures   that   the  
AMC   formed   by   the   fund   sponsor   carries   out   its   duties   in   the   right   spirit   and  
works   in   the   interest   of   the   clients   of   the   AMC   (unit   holders).   SEBI   also  
mandates   that   the   trustee   of   the   fund   is   independent   and   not   associated   with  
the   sponsor   in   any   way.    
AMC   -    The   trust   in   consultation   with   the   fund   sponsor   appoints   an   AMC.   The  
AMC   is   also   called   the   'Investment   Manager'.   The   role   of   the   AMC   is   to   float   a  
mutual   fund   and   manage   the   diﬀerent   investment   schemes   of   the   AMC.   The  
AMC   houses   a   chief   investment   oﬀicer   (CIO),   fund   managers,   analysts,   and  
everyone   responds   to   run   and   manage   the   mutual   fund.   The   AMC   is  
responsible   for   the   operation   and   management   of   diﬀerent   mutual   fund  
schemes,   in   compliance   with   the   SEBI's   rules   and   regulations.    
Think   of   the   AMC   as   the   core   engine   responsible   for   running   the   mutual   fund  
show.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
66    

67    
Custodian   -    The   AMC   now   appoints   a   custodian.   A   custodian's   job   is   to   hold  
all   the   shares   that   the   mutual   fund   buys.   Think   of   the   custodian   as   the   safe  
keepers   or   the   guardians   of   the   mutual   fund   assets.    
RTA   -    The   'Registrar   and   Transfer   Agents'   is   appointed   by   the   AMC.   The   RTA's  
job   is   to   ensure   that   they   serve   the   clients   of   a   mutual   fund   (unit   holders).   The  
services   here   include   issuing   folio   numbers,   transfer   of   unit,   etc.    
The   custodian   and   the   RTA   are   called   the   'service   provider',   for   the   AMC  
company.   
All   the   parties   involved   work   in   synch   to   run   the   mutual   fund   company.   For  
you   as   an   investor,   the   only   two   things   that   matter   is   -   
Who   is   the   sponsor   of   the   AMC,   this   is   to   ensure   you   are   dealing   with   credible  
names   
Who   the   fund   manager   is   -   to   ensure   the   money   is   handled   by   the   right  
person   
Anyway,   let   us   put   all   of   this   information   in   context   before   we   wrap   this  
chapter.   

As   you   can   see,   these   details   belong   to   the   Aditya   Birla   AMC.   
There   are   two   sponsors   here   i.e.   Aditya   Birla   Capital   Limited   and   Sun   Life  
(India)   AMC   Investments   Inc.   These   two   companies   have   jointly   approached  
SEBI   to   procure   an   AMC   license.   Since   there   are   two   fund   sponsors,   this   is   a  
joint   venture   and   the   shareholding   is   as   follows   -   

CHAPTER    7   
Concept   of   fund   &   NAV   
 
7.1   -   The   Family   pot   
I   hope   the   previous   chapter   helped   you   understand   the   structure   of   a   Mutual  
Fund   company.   Although   not   essential,   I   believe   that   the   understanding   of  
the   Mutual   fund   structure   will   help   you   at   some   point   in   your   investment  
journey.   
Moving   ahead,   we   direct   our   eﬀorts   to   learn   more   about   Mutual   fund  
investing.   We   will   learn   about   the   diﬀerent   fund   category,   fund   analysis,   fund  
schemes,   and   many   other   things   associated   with   mutual   fund   investment.  
Now,   before   we   learn   these   concepts,   we   need   to   understand   a   fundamental  
concept.   From   my   observation,   I've   noticed   that   many   people   get   a   bit   lost  
when   we   use   the   term   'fund'   in   the   context   of   a   mutual   fund.   
So   before   we   start   digging   deeper   into   the   mutual   fund   concepts,   we   must   get  
complete   clarity   on   what   the   term   'fund'   means.   
I   will   take   the   liberty   to   simplify   many   things   in   this   chapter;   the  
simplifications   in   this   chapter   are   only   to   help   you   get   the   context   right.   
So   let   us   started,   and   as   usual,   let   us   build   an   imaginary   story   to   help   relate   to  
the   topic   better.   
Now,   think   of   yourself   as   the   stock   market   whiz-kid   in   your   family.   You   have  
made   a   few   successful   stock   investments,   managed   to   score   few  

multi-bagger,   called   the   market   top   and   bottom   couple   of   times,   and   have  
even   managed   to   get   a   selfie   with   Rakesh   Junjunwala   at   an   event.   
The   story   of   your   stock   market   success   has   sent   a   ripple   in   your   family   circuit,  
and   you   are   even   the   centre   of   attention   in   the   family   WhatsApp   group.   
As   expected,   soon,   your   uncles,   aunts,   and   cousins   approach   you   to   help  
them   manage   their   money.   The   quasi   fund   manager   status   that   you   have  
achieved   for   yourself   has   gotten   you   all   excited.   
The   question   is   -   how   will   you   manage   this   money?   
Going   strictly   by   regulations,   unless   you   hold   the   license   for   fund  
management,   like   the   PMS   license   we   discussed   in   the   previous   chapter,   you  
cannot   manage   other   people's   money.   
Given   this,   assume   that   you   apply   for   a   fund   management   license   and  
eventually   procure   one   from   SEBI.   
Now,   you   are   all   set   to   render   your   fund   management   services   to   your   family  
members   and   hopefully   soon   to   many   others   outside   the   family.   
Your   family   members   are   happy   and   are   eager   to   reap   the   benefits   of   your  
fund   management   skills.   The   following   family   members   approach   you   with  
their   money.   The   details   follow   -   
 

So   you   have   five   individual   investors   and   each   one   of   them   has   a   diﬀerent  
amount   of   money   to   invest.   In   total,   across   these   five   individuals,   you   have  
managed   to   pool   in   Rs.275,000/-.   
 
Before   you   get   started,   you   need   to   set   a   few   expectations   -   
All   investors   are   treated   fairly   in   terms   of   return   generated   
You   are   permitted   to   treat   these   individuals   diﬀer   in   terms   of   service  
provided.   For   example,   the   aunt   has   invested   the   highest   amount,   so   maybe  
when   she   visits,   you   can   give   her   coﬀees   and   cookies,   while   the   nephew   has  
invested   the   least,   so   you   can   decide   not   to   oﬀer   the   coﬀee   and   cookies   
 
The   above   two   are   critical   points,   let   us   spend   a   bit   more   time   to   rivet   it.   
Imagine   you   and   I   walk   into   a   restaurant.   You   are   a   regular   at   the   restaurant  
have   been   to   the   restaurant   multiple   times   and   have   generated   enough  
business   for   the   restaurant.   However,   this   is   my   first   visit   to   the   restaurant.   
We   both   end   up   ordering   a   portion   of   biryani.   The   quality   and   quantity   of   the  
biryani   we   both   get   served   will   remain   the   same.   However,   since   you   are  
zerodha.com/varsity    
73    

74    
regular,   the   owner   himself   may   decide   to   serve   you   with   fine   silver   cutlery,  
and   the   owner   may   even   spend   a   few   minutes   chatting   about   your  
well-being.   On   the   other   hand,   I'd   be   served   with   regular   cutlery   and   treated  
like   a   regular   customer.   
However   we   both   get   to   eat   the   same   dish,   no   diﬀerence   there.   
So   you   as   a   fund   manager   can   diﬀerentiate   between   customers   on   how   much  
they   have   invested,   but   should   certainly   not   diﬀerentiate   and   generate   two  
diﬀerent   returns   for   two   diﬀerent   customers   based   on   how   much   they   have  
invested.   They   all   should   experience   the   same   returns. 
In   fact,   in   the   mutual   fund   world,   this   gets   further   streamlined   in   terms   of  
investment   objectives,   mandates,   and   other   things.   We   will   get   to   that   in   the  
next   chapter.   
Anyway,   now   that   the   expectations   are   in   place,   it   now   boils   down   to   logistic  
arrangements   on   how   this   money   gets   managed.   
To   manage   this   money,   you   now   ask   your   family   members   to   transfer   all   the  
money   into   one   single   account.   The   idea   is   to   pool   all   the   money   in   the   same  
account   and   use   that   to   make   investments   in   the   market.   
Since   it's   all   pooled   into   one   account,   that   account   holding   the   funds   belongs  
to   all.   Think   of   this   as   a   rationale   as   to   why   'Mutual   funds'   are   called   'Mutual'  
Funds.   
7.2   -   The   fund   logistics   
As   a   fund   manager,   it   is   your   responsibility   to   ensure   that   those   funds   are  
invested   in   the   stock   market,   and   it   grows   at   a   healthy   rate.   The   selection   of  
zerodha.com/varsity    
74    

75    
stocks   is   your   prerogative,   and   you   get   to   pick   the   stocks,   choose   for   how   long  
to   hold   them   and   decide   when   to   sell   them.   While   you   do   this,   you   need   to  
ensure   that   every   investor   of   yours   is   given   the   same   treatment   in   terms   of  
wealth   creation.   
Remember,   you   are   pooling   all   individual   monies   and   investing   it   as   a   whole  
aka   a   fund.   So   the   return   experienced   by   the   investors   should   be   uniform.   
So   given   this,   how   do   we   ensure   we   have   an   equitable   distribution   of   returns  
across   all   the   clients?   
To   do   this,   we   can   start   by   issuing   shares   against   the   investment   made   by  
each   investor.   We   can   start   by   assigning   a   notional   value   to   each   of   these  
shares.   
This   notional   value   or   the   initial   value   can   be   anything,   and   you   can   assign  
5,10,50,   or   even   100   as   the   starting   value.   It   does   not   matter.   The   most  
popular   notional   value   if   Rs.10,   so   we   will   stick   to   that.   
We   now   issue   Rs.10/-   notional   value   shares   to   all   our   investors   and   estimate  
the   number   of   shares   each   investor   holds.   For   example,   the   uncle   has  
invested   Rs.65,000/-,   so   he   gets   -   
=   65,000/10   
=   6500   shares.   
The   table   now   looks   like   this   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
75    

76    
 
The   total   number   of   shares   distributed   across   the   five   investors   is   27,500,  
which,   when   multiplied   by   the   notional   value,   i.e.   10,   gives   us   the   total   corpus  
value,   i.e.   Rs.275,000/-.   
Alright,   now   that   the   fund   is   formed   and   shares   distributed   across   clients,   the  
fund   manager   gets   to   work   on   things   he   is   best   at,   i.e.   to   pick   stocks   and  
invest   the   money.   
As   a   fund   manager,   you   decide   to   invest   the   funds,   i.e.   Rs.275,000/-   across   ten  
stocks.   For   the   sake   of   simplicity,   you   choose   to   invest   the   same   amount  
across   all   the   ten   stocks.   The   distribution   of   funds   in   this   manner   is   referred  
to   as   the   'equally   distributed   portfolio'.   
The   total   corpus   is   Rs.275,000/-,   so   each   stock   gets   an   investment   of  
Rs.27,500/-.   
The   division   of   funds   across   the   ten   diﬀerent   stocks   look   like   this   -   
 
zerodha.com/varsity    
76    

77    
As   you   can   see,   the   money   invested   across   ten   diﬀerent   stocks,   each   with  
diﬀerent   share   price,   but   the   same   investment   goes   to   every   stock,   i.e.  
Rs.27,500/-   
At   this   stage,   two   things   are   in   place   -   
The   shares   are   issued   to   all   investors.   The   number   of   shares   is   proportional   to  
the   individual   investment   made   
The   funds   are   invested   in   the   markets   across   ten   diﬀerent   stocks   
Now,   once   the   funds   are   entirely   invested   in   the   market,   the   value   of   the  
overall   fund   depends   on   how   the   shares   perform   daily.   A   few   stocks   can   go  
up,   and   a   few   can   come   down,   resulting   in   either   a   profit   or   a   loss.   This   profit  
and   loss   should   be   passed   to   the   investors.   The   quantum   of   profit   or   loss  
experienced   by   the   investors   is   directly   dependent   on   the   amount   of   money  
each   investor   has   invested   in   the   fund.   
Let's   continue   the   example   to   see   how   the   P&L   pass   through   happens.   I've  
randomly   assigned   percentage   movement   to   all   these   stocks.   
 
As   you   can   see,   the   stock   prices   have   changed   on   day   2,   thereby   the   invested  
value   across   each   share   also   varies   accordingly.   As   a   result   of   this   change,   the  
zerodha.com/varsity    
77    

78    
total   value   of   the   portfolio   is   Rs.277,844.   The   fund   has   generated   a   one   day  
return   of   Rs.2,844/-   or   1.0340%.   
The   profit   of   Rs.2,844/-   has   to   be   distributed   across   all   the   five   investors   in  
proportion   to   their   investments.   To   ensure   a   fair   distribution,   all   we   need   to  
do   is,   ensure   the   notional   value   goes   up   (or   down)   by   the   same   percentage   as  
the   fund,   which   is   1.0340%   in   this   case.   
Initial   notional   value   (day   1)   -   10   
P&L   %   in   funds   -   1.0340%   
New   notional   value   (day   2)   -   10   *(1+1.0340%)   =   10.1034   
So,   the   new   notional   value   is   10.1034,   multiplying   this   with   the   number   of  
shares   should   result   in   the   new   investment   value   for   the   investor.   
 
As   you   can   see,   the   investment   for   each   of   the   investors   has   gone   up   by   the  
same   percentage   point,   but   the   absolute   money   made   by   them   diﬀers,   based  
on   the   initial   investment   amount.   
Also,   if   you   add   up   all   the   new   investment   amount,   you   will   get   the   new   fund  
value,   i.e.   Rs.277,844/-.   
Before   we   wind   up   this   chapter,   I   want   you   to   remember   these   points   in   the  
context   of   a   mutual   fund   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
78    

79    
An   investment   fund   is   formed   when   diﬀerent   people   pool   in   their   money   
The   investment   objective   remains   the   same   across   all   the   investors   
Notional   value   is   assigned   at   the   start   of   the   fund   formation,   which   then  
fluctuates   based   on   the   daily   investment   value.   In   the   Mutual   fund   world,   this  
is   called   the   ' Net   Asset   Value '.    
A   mutual   fund's   net   asset   value   or   NAV   is   one   of   the   most   important   metrics.  
On   an   end   of   day   basis,   the   mutual   fund   company   does   the   following  
calculations   -   
The   value   of   all   the   investments   
Expenses   of   running   the   mutual   fund   
Based   on   these   two   parameters,   the   NAV   of   a   fund   is   estimated   daily.   The  
formula   to   calculate   the   NAV   is   -   
NAV   =   (Value   of   all   the   assets   -   the   expenses)/number   of   shares   (units)   
I'll   end   this   chapter   here.   I'll   be   happy   if   you   have   fully   understood   the  
concept   of   what   a   fund   is   and   the   role   NAV   plays.   
We   are   still   in   the   early   stage   of   the   learning   curve,   and   we   will   revisit   these  
topics.   However,   before   I   wind   up   this   chapter,   I   have   a   question   for   you  
related   to   the   example   we   used   in   this   chapter.    
On   day   3,   suppose   your   father   in   law   approaches   you   and   wants   to   invest  
Rs.75,000/-,   at   what   rate   will   you   issue   the   shares   to   him?   
Would   it   be   Rs.10   (initial   value)   or   Rs.10.1034/-?   

Key   takeaways   from   this   chapter    
● In   a   mutual   fund,   diﬀerent   people   invest   in   a   collective  
investment   vehicle   with   a   common   investment   objective   
● Every   investor   in   a   mutual   fund   is   treated   equally   in   terms   of  
percentage   return   
● At   the   start   of   the   fund   activity,   every   investor   is   issued  
shares/units   at   a   notional   value   
● The   value   of   the   shares/units   change   based   on   how   invested  
assets   perform   daily   

CHAPTER    8   
The   mutual   fund   fact-sheet 
 
8.1   -   The   Mutual   Fund   world   
In   the   previous   chapter,   we   set   up   a   hypothetical   situation   that   helped   us  
understand   the   concept   of   a   fund   and   how   it   gets   managed.   We   discussed   the  
idea   of   'pooling   of   funds'   to   invest   in   the   market   with   a   common   purpose.   I  
agree   we   oversimplified   the   previous   chapter,   but   that's   ok   as   the   objective   at  
this   point   is   to   understand   the   fund   structure   and   the   way   it   serves   its  
investors.   
I   also   hope   you   are   clear   about   the   concept   of   'Net   asset   value   or   the   NAV'.  
The   mutual   fund   NAV   or   the   mutual   fund   unit   is   an   elementary   concept,   and   I  
hope   you   have   no   confusion   about   this.   If   yes,   I   would   urge   you   to   read   the  
previous   chapter   once   again.   
We   will,   in   this   chapter,   take   that   conversation   forward   and   look   at   one   of   the  
most   crucial   documents   from   a   fund   house,   i.e.   the   Fund   fact   sheet.   The  
factsheet   is   a   document   that   puts   up   all   the   information   related   to   a  
fund/scheme.   By   and   large,   everything   that   you   need   to   know   before  
investing   in   a   particular   fund   is   available   in   the   fund   fact   sheet.   In   this  
chapter,   we   will   look   at   fund   factsheet   and   figure   out   how   to   read   and  
understand   the   same.   

Before   we   get   to   the   fund's   fact   sheet,   I   think   it   is   essential   to   get   a   grip   on  
how   wide   and   deep   the   Indian   Mutual   fund   industry   is.   The   discussion   will  
help   you   understand   the   length   and   breadth   of   the   mutual   fund   industry   -   
So   here   are   necessary   details   for   you   (as   on   Dec   2019)   -   
The   number   of   fund   houses    -    43 .   These   are   the   number   of   mutual   fund  
companies   who   have   obtained   the   AMC   license   from   SEBI.   Example:   Kotak 
AMC,   HDFC   AMC,   ICICI   Pru   AMC,   Axis   AMC,   DSP   etc.    
The   number   of   scheme    -    2035 .   Each   fund   house   (AMC),   can   run   multiple 
schemes   for   people   to   invest.   For   example,   ICICI   Pru   AMC   runs   243   diﬀerent  
schemes,   probably   the   highest   in   the   industry.   Franklin   AMC   runs   about   67,  
Aditya   Birla   AMC   manages   around   163   schemes.   A   scheme   is   a   fund   with   a  
specific   investment   objective,   more   about   this   when   we   dig   into   the  
factsheet.    
Money   managed   by   AMCs    -    26L     Crore .   This   is   the   aggregate   amount   of  
money   managed   by   the   entire   mutual   fund   industry   (across   all   AMCs).   For  

example,   HDFC   AMC,   which   is   one   of   the   largest   AMC,   manages   about   3.7L  
Crs.   Axis   AMC,   on   the   other   hand,   manages   about   1.05L   Crs.   Yes   AMC   manages  
about   916   Crs.   This   money   is   coming   in   from   retail   individuals   and   corporates.  
Out   of   this   25.68L   Crs,   roughly   14.5L   Cr   is   from   retail   investors   like   you   and  
me,   and   about   12L   Crs   is   from   the   corporates    
The   number   of   unique   Investors    -    2   Crs   Indians.    This   is   the   number   of  
individual   investors   investing   in   Mutual   funds   schemes   across   all   the   AMCs.    
Again,   these   are   good   to   know   numbers   to   put   things   in   some   perspective.  
You   need   not   have   to   know   these   numbers   if   your   objective   is   to   invest   in   the  
markets   via   mutual   funds.   
8.2   -   The   fund   factsheet   
An   asset   management   company   (AMC),   manages   and   runs   a   mutual   fund  
scheme.   An   AMC   can   run   many   schemes   as   long   as   they   have   SEBI's   approval  
for   it.   A   mutual   fund   scheme   is   essentially   a   fund   with   a   specific   investment  
objective.   An   investment   objective   is   the   stated   goal   of   the   fund.   For   example,  
the   investment   objective   of   a   mutual   fund   scheme   could   be   an   investment   in  
the   top   100   large-cap   companies   in   the   country   or   it   could   be   an   investment  
in   the   top   100   small-cap   companies,   so   on   and   so   forth.   The   investment  
objective   is   stated   at   the   inception   of   the   fund,   and   the   fund   manager   is  
expected   to   stick   to   this   mandate   until   the   life   of   the   fund.   
So   let   us   pick   a   fund   fact   sheet   and   dig   into   what   information   is   available   to  
us.   Let   us   start   with   Kotak   AMC.   
By   the   way,   I've   randomly   selected   Kotak   AMC,   please   don't   consider   this   as   a  
recommendation   of   any   sort   
🙂

I   can   go   to   AMC's   website   to   find   the   fund's   factsheet.   Here   is   the   snapshot   of  
the   same   -   
 
 
 
As   you   can   see,   there   are   many   diﬀerent   tabs   right   at   the   top   -   Equity,   Tax  
Saver,   Hybrid,   Debt,   Liquid   etc.   These   are   all   diﬀerent   categories   of   funds.  
Over   the   next   few   chapters,   we   will   understand   what   each   of   these   categories  
means   and   what   to   expect   from   investments   made   in   these   categories.   For  
now,   let   us   stick   to   'Equity'   as   a   category.   As   you   can   see,   there   are   many  
diﬀerent   funds/schemes   under   Equity   as   a   category.   Let   us   pick   'Kotak   Small  
Cap   Fund'   and   see   what   goes   in   the   fact   sheet.   Click   on   the   link,   and   you   will  
find   the   fund's   factsheet.   In   Kotak's   case,   they   call   this   the   'One   Pager'.   Fair  
enough.   
SEBI   has   mandated   that   the   name   of   the   fund   should   be   indicative   of   what  
the   fund   is   like   to   do.   So   moment   I   read,   'Kotak   Small   Cap   Fund',   I   know   that  
this   is   a   fund   which   focuses   on   small-cap   investments.   
I've   downloaded   the   fund's   one-pager,   and   here   is   the   very   first   page   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
84    

85    
 
The   introductory   paragraph   gives   us   information   on   the   stated   objective   of  
the   fund.   As   you   can   see,   the   stated   objective   says   'Kotak   Small   Cap   generates  
capital   appreciation   from   a   diversified   portfolio   of   equity   &   equity-related  
securities   by   investing   predominantly   in   the   small   market   capitalisation  
companies   across   sectors'    
From   this,   we   can   infer   -   
1. The   fund   manager   intends   to   have   a   diversified   portfolio;   therefore   it   is  
not   focused   on   a   specific   sector   
2. Investments   are   in   Equity   and   equity-related   securities.   This   is   mainly  
stocks   
zerodha.com/varsity    
85    

86    
3. Investments   are   predominantly   in   the   small   market   capitalisation  
companies,   which   means   as   the   fund   name   suggests,   they   look   at  
investments   in   the   small-cap   company   
4. The   second   section   talks   a   bit   about   how   they   intend   to   research   these  
small-cap   stocks.   Frankly,   this   should   not   be   of   concern   to   you.   I   mean   think  
about   it   -   if   you   knew   what   to   look   for   when   investing   in   a   stock   or   if   you   had  
an   opinion   on   what   makes   a   good   stock,   then   you   are   better   oﬀ   investing   in  
the   stocks   directly   right?   Why   mutual   funds   at   all?   
But   since   the   information   is   any   way   out   there,   here   is   a   sneak   peek   into   their 
research   methodology   -   
Look   at   the   integrity   of   the   promoters    -   necessarily   ensure   they   are   not  
scammy    
Ability   to   generate   cashflow    -   meaning   they   look   for   companies   that   are  
operationally   profitable   and   capable   of   producing   a   surplus   over   all   the  
expenses    
Experience   of   market   cycles    -   ensure   that   the   company   has   survived  
through   the   test   of   times   and   has   proved   its   resilience    
Simple   business   model    -   No   complicated   verticals   and   easy   to   understand  
companies    
Quality   metrics    -   This   means   that   all   the   financial   ratios   tick   right    
Business   quality    -   Good   quality   business   I   guess   J    
Low   leverage    -   Companies   with   very   little   or   zero   debt    
Now,   I   can   decipher   this   because   I   belong   to   the   same   industry.   However,  
most   of   the   investors   cannot   read   through   these   terms,   and   frankly,   as   I  
mentioned   earlier,   you   don't   have   to   worry   about   this.   

8.3   -   Other   fund   facts   
The   fund   fact   sheet   presents   a   lot   more   interesting   data   points.   We   will   also  
use   this   opportunity   to   understand   some   of   the   key   jargons   used   in   the  
mutual   fund   world.   Here   is   the   snapshot   for   the   fund's   other   facts   -   
 
The   initial   section   is   the   investment   objective,   which   we   reviewed   earlier,   so  
we   will   skip   this   section.   The   next   thing   you   can   notice   is   the   benchmark   of  
the   fund.   A   mutual   fund   scheme   should   essentially   benchmark   itself   to   an  
index.   This   is   required   to   evaluate   the   performance   of   the   fund   over   a   period.  
A   mutual   fund   should   have   the   appropriate   benchmark.   For   example,   a  
small-cap   fund   is   benchmarked   against   a   small-cap   index,   as   in   this   case.   It   is  
almost   mis-spelling   if   the   benchmark   is   not   appropriate,   for   example,   a  
small-cap   fund   being   benchmarked   against   a   large-cap   index.   To   put   this  
context,   the   performance   of   a   family   car   such   as   Wagon   R   should  
zerodha.com/varsity    
87    

88    
benchmarked   against   another   family   car   such   as   maybe   a   Swi,   and   it   would  
be   futile   to   benchmark   it   against   a   Ferrari.   
The   next   section   details   the   type   of   scheme;   there   are   a   couple   of   exciting  
things   to   note   here.   The   type   is-   Open-ended,   equity,   growth   scheme.   There  
are   three   critical   parameters   here;   let   us   understand   what   it   means.   
Open-ended    -   When   an   AMC   starts   a   fund,   they   have   the   option   to   let   that  
fund   run   for   either   a   fixed   period   or   keep   it   going   forever.   For   example,   I   can  
start   a   fund   today   and   let   it   run   for   three   years   from   today,   at   the   end   of   3 
rd 
 
year,   the   fund   will   cease   to   exist,   and   the   investor   is   obligated   to   collect   his  
money   back   (along   with   the   profit   or   losses).   Funds   with   such   defined   time  
are   called   a   ' closes   ended   fund '.   If   a   fund   does   not   have   an   expiry   date,   then  
it's   called   an   open-ended   fund.   For   all   practical   purposes,   its   always   good   to  
deal   with   an   open-ended   fund    
Equity    -   This   is   a   reference   to   the   asset   class   the   mutual   fund   invests.   Equity,  
as   you   know,   refers   to   the   shares   listed   in   the   market.   Another   asset   class   is  
debt,   which   could   be   either   corporate   debt   or   PSU   debt.   More   on   this   when  
we   deep   dive   into   debt   funds    
Growth    -   Let   us   skip   this   for   now.   We   will   discuss   this   in   a   bit.    
Apart   from   this,   this   section   also   details   a   few   other   things   - 
Fund   Manager    -   I   find   this   interesting   to   know   who   is   managing   the   fund.   I   do  
a   quick   google   search   to   know   his   background   and   his   past   performance.  
Aer   all,   he   will   be   responsible   for   managing   our   hard-earned   money,   so   it  
makes   sense   to   see   a   bit   about   his   background    
zerodha.com/varsity    
88    

89    
Allotment   date    -   This   is   the   date   from   which   the   fund   commenced   its  
operations.   The   allotment   date   gives   you   a   sense   of   how   old   the   fund   is.   It   is  
not   that   it   matters,   but   the   older   the   fund,   slightly   easy   it   gets   to   analyse   vis   a  
viz   a   new   fund.    
The   next   section   deals   with   'Plans   &   Options'.   Under   plans,   there   are   two  
variants   -   
Regular   plan    -   This   is   interesting.   Think   about   a   farmer   growing   onions.   He  
nurtures   the   onion   saplings,   waters   it,   weeds   it,   and   eventually   harvests   it  
and   gets   the   onion   ready   for   consumption.   Let   us   say   the   cost   of   the   onion   is  
about   Rs.30/-   per   Kg   at   this   point.   An   intermediary   now   acts   as   an   'agent'   and  
delivers   the   onion   to   people   like   you   and   me,   and   we,   in   turn,   pay   him   Rs.40/-  
per   Kg.   The   delta   (Rs.10),   is   what   the   agent   earns.   Now   replace   the   farmer  
with   the   AMC,   the   onions   with   a   fund/scheme,   and   the   agent   as   a   mutual   fund  
distributor.   The   mutual   fund   distributor   is   like   the   middleman   between   the 
AMC   and   the   investor.   If   a   mutual   fund   distributor   approaches   you   and   sells  
you   a   mutual   fund,   then   he   is   selling   you   a   'regular   plan',   which   means   he   is  
entitled   to   receive   a   commission   from   the   AMC   for   selling   this   fund   to   you.  
There   is   nothing   wrong   with   this,   except   that   the   money   is   going   from   your  
pocket.    
Direct   plan    -   Now   you   don't   need   to   buy   the   fund   via   a   distributor.   If   you  
know   which   fund   to   buy,   capable   of   doing   your   mutual   fund   research   (which  
by   the   way   is   the   end   objective   of   this   module),   then   you   can   buy   that   fund  
directly   from   the   AMC.   When   you   buy   directly   from   the   AMC,   then   there   is   no  
distributor   involved;   hence   the   distributor   commissions   are   not   paid,   which  
zerodha.com/varsity    
89    

90    
means   you   save   on   commissions,   which   naturally   means   a   better   return   on  
your   investment.    
Just   to   let   you   know,   when   you   buy   mutual   funds   via   Zerodha,   you   are   buying  
a   direct   plan;   hence   you   will   enjoy   a   better   return.   We   will   deep   dive   into   this  
topic   later   in   this   module,   but   for   now,   remember   when   you   invest   in   mutual  
funds,   opt   for   a   direct   plan   as   you   will   save   on   commissions   and   therefore  
enjoy   the   better   return.   
The   other   bit   in   this   section   is   about   the   option.   As   you   can   see,   this   fund   has  
two   options   -   
Dividend   payout    -   Think   about   it,   when   you   buy   a   stock   of   a   company   and  
the   company   issues   a   dividend,   then   as   an   investor,   you   are   entitled   to  
receive   these   dividends   right?   Likewise,   when   the   fund   manager   buys   the  
stock   of   a   company,   and   the   company   issues   a   dividend,   then   the   AMC  
receives   this   divided.   Since   the   funds   with   the   AMC   belongs   to   the   investors,  
this   dividend   belongs   to   the   investors.   The   dividend   you   are   entitled   to   obtain  
from   the   AMC   is   to   the   extent   you've   invested   in   the   fund.   The   AMC   gives   you  
two   options   -   you   can   withdraw   this   dividend,   or   you   can   choose   to   reinvest  
the   dividend   amount   and   buy   more   units   of   the   fund.   The   dividend   payout  
option   helps   you   withdraw   the   dividend   as   and   when   the   dividend   gets   paid.    
There   are   technicalities   here   as   to   how   the   AMCs   issue   dividends.   We   will  
discuss   this   at   a   later   point.   
Dividend   reinvestment   plan    -   This   plan   receives   the   dividend   on   your   behalf  
and   reinvests   the   dividend   into   the   same   fund.   So   necessarily,   you   don't   get  
the   dividend   in   the   form   of   cash,   but   instead   more   units   or   NAV   of   the   same  
fund.

91    
Growth   plan   -    In   the   growth   plan,   the   investor   does   not   receive   any  
dividends.   The   profits   earned   are   ploughed   back   to   fund   and   therefore   the  
'compounding   eﬀect',   works   well   here.   I   personally   prefer   this   plan   over   the  
other   two.    
Next   up   is   the   SIP   details.   SIP   stands   for   'systematic   investment   plan'.   In   a  
typical   SIP,   you   will   invest   the   same   amount   of   money   every   month   for   as  
many   years   as   possible.   Example   of   a   SIP   is   investing   say   Rs.5000/-   in   Kotak  
Small-cap   fund   on   5 
th  
  of   every   month   for   as   many   months   as   possible.   Think  
of   SIP   as   investing   in   instalments.   SIP   is   perhaps   one   of   the   most   significant  
financial   inventions   and   has   many   merits   to   it.   Given   the   importance   of   this  
topic,   I   think   a   separate   chapter   on   this   topic   is   justified,   and   we   will   do   that  
at   a   later   point.   For   now,   think   of   SIP   in   its   basic   form,   i.e.   to   invest   a   fixed  
amount   of   money   every   month   in   the   same   fund   for   many   years.   
As   you   can   see,   you   can   SIP   on   Kotak   Small-cap   fund,   but   for   that,   the   AMC  
has   specified   that   the   minimum   SIP   amount   every   month   is   Rs.1000/-   and   the  
minimum   number   of   months   is   six.   
The   next   section   talks   about   the   initial   minimum   investment   in   the   fund.   This  
is   self-explanatory,   if   you   choose   not   to   SIP,   then   the   minimum   amount   to  
invest   is   Rs.500/-   and   Rs.1000/-   for   the   monthly   SIP.   
The   last   section   of   the   fact   sheet   talks   about   the   load   structure   of   the   fund.  
There   is   a   mention   of   few   terms   here   like   the   SIP,   STP,   switches   etc.   We   will  
club   all   these   in   the   SIP   chapter.   For   now,   let's   talk   about   the   'load   structure'.   
The   load   structure   is   essentially   the   amount   of   money,   in   percentage   terms;  
you   will   have   to   pay   in   case   you   wish   to   withdraw   from   the   fund.   As   you   can  
see,   there   are   two   types   of   load   structure   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
91    

92    
Entry   load    -   This   is   no   longer   applicable.   However,   years   ago,   you'd   have   to  
pay   a   percentage   for   investing   your   money   in   a   mutual   fund.   I   guess   AMC's  
have   to   mention   'entry   load'   as   nil   for   legacy   reasons.    
Exit   load    -   This   is   the   amount   of   money   you   will   have   to   pay   at   the   time   of  
withdrawal.   As   you   can   see,   there   is   a   1%   load   if   you   wish   to   withdraw   before  
the   completion   of   1   year   and   no-load   post   that.    
8.4   -   Riskometer   
Every   AMC   is   supposed   to   self-asses   the   riskiness   of   the   fund   and   lets   the  
customers   know   about   this.   The   self-assessment   is   something   that   SEBI  
mandates   to   avoid   cases   of   the   misspelling   of   the   financial   product.   For  
example,   a   small-cap   fund   should   not   be   packaged   as   a   low-risk   fund   and  
sold   to   the   investors.   
Here   is   how   the   AMC   does   a   self-assessment   of   risk   -   
 
The   needle   of   the   riskometer   points   to   'moderately   high',   meaning   that   the  
Kotak   Smallcap   fund   is   risky.   The   text   next   to   the   riskometer   reiterates   this.  
Now,   agreed   this   is   a   risky   fund,   but   that   should   not   stop   you   from   investing  
in   risky   funds.   
Remember,   the   antidote   for   'risk'   in   the   mutual   fund   world   is   'time';   hence   the  
longer   you   stay   invested   in   a   mutual   fund,   the   safer   it   gets.   

Key   takeaways   from   this   chapter    
● The   factsheet   of   a   mutual   fund   details   all   the   essential  
parameters   worth   knowing   about   the   mutual   fund   
● The   investment   objective   of   a   fund   is   essentially   the   guiding  
principle   for   the   investment   the   fund   manager   makes   
● Open-ended   funds   don't   have   an   'expiry'   for   the   fund.   It   can   go  
on   forever   
● Close-ended   funds   are   time-bound   
● Regular   plans   pay   out   distributor   commissions,   hence   lower  
yield   to   investors   
● The   direct   plan   does   not   pay   distributor   commissions;   hence  
the   returns   are   higher   for   the   investor   

CHAPTER    9   
The   Equity   scheme   (Part   1)   
 
9.1   -   October   2017   
The   previous   chapter   hopefully   has   given   you   some   insights   into   reading   a  
mutual   fund   factsheet.   The   factsheet   lists   some   of   the   good   to   know  
information   about   a   mutual   fund.   Do   remember,   the   factsheet   also   doubles  
up   as   a   marketing   document   for   the   Asset   Management   Company   (AMC),  
hence   read   through   the   fund's   factsheet   with   a   pinch   of   salt.   
Starting   from   this   chapter,   we   will   shi   our   focus   on   the   mutual   fund  
categories.   The   idea   is   to   discuss   the   main   categories   and   a   few   subcategories  
of   mutual   funds.   
Please   note,   the   term   'subcategory'   in   the   context   of   mutual   fund   categories  
does   not   exist,   but   I   think   it   makes   life   simpler   if   you   thought   about   the  
mutual   fund   categories   this   way.   
I'm   not   sure   if   we   can   cover   all   the   subcategories   in   this   module.   For   example,  
Debt   fund   as   a   main   mutual   fund   category   has   nearly   16   diﬀerent  
subcategories,   equity   as   a   category   has   about   10/11   subcategories.   Given  
this,   as   you   can   imagine,   discussing   the   entire   gamut   of   MF   categories   will  
digress   us   from   the   central   theme   of   this   module   which   is   personal   finance.  
The   idea   here   is   to   lay   down   a   foundation   for   you   to   understand   the   main  
mutual   fund   category   (and   a   few   subcategories)   and   hopefully,   this  
zerodha.com/varsity    
94    



95    
foundation   will   help   you   understand   the   many   subcategories   of   mutual   fund  
schemes.   
No   discussion   on   the   mutual   fund   universe   is   complete   without   touching  
upon   the   SEBI's   October   2017   circular   on   MF   categorisation.   This   circular   from  
SEBI   was   fairly   significant,   and   it   helped   simplify   the   MF   universe.   To  
appreciate   why   this   SEBI   circular   is   essential,   we   need   to   dig   up   a   bit   of  
history.   
Back   in   the   days,   the   mutual   fund   world   was   a   bit   chaotic.   The   asset  
management   companies   would   float   many   diﬀerent   schemes   with  
overlapping   investment   ideologies.   These   funds   would   oen   confuse   or  
mislead   investors.   For   example,   an   AMC   would   run   a   'large-cap   fund',   which  
by   definition   should   predominantly   have   only   large-cap   stock,   but   these  
AMCs   would   stuﬀ   in   small-cap   stocks,   which   as   you   can   imagine   bumps   up  
the   volatility   (and   the   return)   of   the   fund.   A   typical   large-cap   investor   would  
sign   up   for   the   market   returns   plus   lower   volatility,   but   the   presence   of  
small-cap   stocks   in   a   large-cap   fund   kind   of   defeats   the   purpose. 
Here   are   a   bunch   of   other   problems   that   existed   pre-Oct   2017;   these  
problems   existed   mainly   due   to   the   lack   of   proper   mutual   fund   classifications  
and   definitions.   
Multiple   funds    -   An   AMC   would   launch   numerous   funds   with   similar  
investment   objectives.   For   instance,   it   was   common   for   an   AMC   to   have  
multiple   large-cap   or   mid-cap   schemes,   while   all   these   funds   had   the   same  
investment   objective.   The   distinction   between   the   funds   was   not   too   clear.    
Lack   of   definition    -   While   an   AMC   would   title   their   scheme   as   a   large   or  
mid-cap   fund,   it   would   contain   stocks   from   other   market   capitalisation.   The  
zerodha.com/varsity    
95    

96    
problem   occurred   because   there   was   no   formal   definition   of   market  
capitalisation.    
Portfolio   composition    -   The   mutual   fund   schemes   lacked   a   clear   definition  
in   terms   of   portfolio   composition.   For   instance,   the   portfolio   of   a   mid-cap  
fund   is   expected   to   hold   mid-cap   stocks,   but   it   was   common   to   find   funds  
with   a   large   proportion   of   small-cap   stocks   while   the   name   of   the   fund  
suggested   the   fund   was   a   mid-cap   focused   fund.    
These   problems   led   to   a   series   of   other   issues.   One   of   the   major   concerns   was  
with   benchmarking   of   funds.   A   large-cap   fund   is   benchmarked   against   a   Niy  
50   index;   now   we   have   a   problem   if   a   fund   with   small-cap   stocks   gets  
disguised   as   a   large-cap   fund   and   gets   benchmarked   against   a   large-cap  
index.   The   performance   of   such   a   'large-cap   fund'   (at   least   in   bull   markets)   is  
bound   to   get   skewed   and   oﬀers   an   abnormal   positive   return,   oen  
misleading   the   investor.   
SEBI   addressed   these   problems   with   the   Oct   2017   circular.   You   can   find   the  
original   circular    here.    
The   circular   clearly   defined   the   market   capitalisation   of   stock,   which   naturally  
solved   a   few   legacy   issues   in   the   mutual   fund   world.   As   per   the   definition   -   
Large-cap   stocks    -   1 
st  
  to   100 
th  
  company   in   terms   of   full   market   capitalisation    
Mid-cap   stocks   -    101 
st  
  to   250 
th  
  company   in   terms   of   full   market   capitalisation    
Small-cap   stocks    -   250 
th  
  company   onwards   in   terms   of   full   market  
capitalisation    
With   this   formal   definition,   there   was   no   longer   ambiguity   on   the   market  
capitalization,   and   the   AMCs   were   now   forced   to   comply   with   the   definitions.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
96    



97    
Further,   SEBI   mandated   that   an   AMC   can   have   only   one   scheme   in   any  
category   (except   for   the   thematic,   index   fund,   and   fund   of   funds).   This  
mandate   put   a   stop   to   AMCs   oﬀering   a   bouquet   of   schemes   with   an  
overlapping   investment   thesis.   To   make   things   clear,   SEBI   defined   the  
portfolio   composition   as   well.   To   put   this   context,   post   the   circular,   if   an   AMC  
were   to   run   a   large-cap   fund,   then   SEBI   not   only   defined   what   large-cap   is   but  
also   set   the   minimum   number   of   large-cap   stocks   (in   %   terms)   the   fund  
should   hold   in   its   portfolio.   
Anyway,   let   us   jump   to   the   diﬀerent   mutual   fund   categories   and  
subcategories   and   start   exploring   them.   The   idea   here   is   to   understand   these  
categories   and   invest   in   them   based   on   our   financial   situation   in   life.   
 
9.2   -   The   Mutual   fund   universe   
Primarily,   there   are   five   diﬀerent   categories   of   mutual   funds   under   which  
there   are   many   diﬀerent   categories.   Think   of   them   as   a   'category   -  
subcategory'   way   of   classification.   Here   are   the   main   categories   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
97    

98    
1. Equity   
2. Debt   
3. Hybrid   
4. Solution-oriented   
5. Other   schemes 
The   entire   'category   -   subcategory'   structure   is   as   follows   -   
 
To   begin   with,   we   will   focus   on   Equity   as   a   category.   As   per   SEBI's   circular,   an  
AMC   is   supposed   to   run   only   one   scheme   per   category.   For   example,   an   AMC  
can   have   only   one   large-cap,   one   mid-cap,   one   small-cap   so   and   so   forth.   
However,   under   Equity,   an   AMC   can   have   multiple   sectoral   funds.   
9.3   -   Equity   Category   
The   equity   category   is   perhaps   the   most   popular   MF   category   in   terms   of  
retail   participation.   As   the   name   suggests,   the   schemes   under   the   equity  
category   invest   in   listed   company   shares.   As   you   are   aware,   there   are   many  
diﬀerent   styles   of   investment   in   the   market.   A   few   of   these   popular   styles  
have   been   picked   and   formally   inducted   into   the   'Equity   category'.   As   you   can  
see   from   the   image   above,   here   are   nearly   11   diﬀerent   subcategories   within  
zerodha.com/varsity    
98    

99    
the   Equity   category.   Each   of   these   categories   is   a   diﬀerent   style   of   investing   in  
the   market,   and   they   all   diﬀer   in   their   risk   and   reward   characteristics.  
However,   the   general   philosophy   of   investing   in   an   equity   scheme   remains  
the   same,   i.e.   to   generate   wealth.   What   diﬀers   across   these   categories   is  
essentially   the   timeline   of   this   wealth   generation   and   like   I   mentioned,   the  
risk   and   reward.   
Over   the   years,   thanks   to   my   profession,   I've   had   the   opportunity   to   interact  
with   many   people   about   mutual   fund   investing.   One   thing   that   I   can   tell   you  
with   confidence   is   that   most   of   them   approach   mutual   fund   investing   (at   least  
in   the   equity   funds)   with   unrealistic   expectations.   Some   even   go   to   the   extent  
of   looking   at   mutual   funds   as   a   proxy   for   direct   stock   investing.   They   almost  
have   a   trading   attitude   with   their   funds.   Such   an   approach   to   mutual   fund  
investing   can   have   dangerous   consequences   for   your   capital.   
Unless   you   have   the   right   expectation   and   attitude   towards   equity   investing,  
it   is   nearly   impossible   to   generate   wealth   from   mutual   fund   investing.   So  
what   is   the   right   expectation/attitude   when   investing   in   an   equity-oriented  
mutual   fund.   
Well,   the   true   answer   to   this   question   depends   on   the   exact   subcategory   of  
the   mutual   fund   you   are   looking   at.   However,   here   are   a   few   generic   pitfalls   to  
avoid   -   
Not   a   short   term   solution    -   Equity   oriented   mutual   funds   are   not   a   solution  
for   your   short   term   financial   goals.   By   short   term,   I   mean   2-3   years   kind   of  
time   frame.   Invest   in   equity-oriented   funds   only   if   you   have   the   necessary  
time   it   deserves.   To   put   this   in   context,   I   started   investing   in   an   equity   mutual  
fund   in   2006,   it   is   the   14 
th  
  year   as   of   2020,   and   I   continue   to   invest   in   it.   I'm   not  
zerodha.com/varsity    
99    

100    
suggesting   that   you   need   to   stay   invested   for   this   long   a   period,   all   I'm   trying  
to   say   is   that   you   need   to   have   a   super   long   term   approach   to   mutual   funds.  
I'd   say   at   least   ten   plus   years   (my   personal   opinion).   Anything   lower   than   this  
can   be   a   futile   attempt   at   wealth   creation.    
Why   not   short   term?    -   One   of   the   common   follow   up   questions   is   why   not  
consider   equity   mutual   fund   for   short   term   investments.   Well,   there   have  
been   instances   where   short   term   mutual   fund   returns   have   swelled.   It  
requires   a   great   amount   of   market   study   to   figure   and   time   this.   Now,   if   you   as  
a   common   man   investing   in   the   market   can   time   the   market,   then   why   invest  
in   mutual   funds   at   all?   You   may   as   well   invest   in   stocks   directly,   right?    
Understand   time    -   You   may   have   heard   of   the   saying,   'time   heals   everything'.  
Well,   this   is   true   for   market   volatility   as   well.   The   market   is   volatile;   this   is   the  
very   nature   of   this   beast.   However,   the   only   way   for   a   common   man   to   deal  
with   volatility   is   to   give   your   investment   suﬀicient   time.   Hence,   a   short   term  
approach   to   MF   investing   does   not   work.    
Don't   keep   switching    -   I've   seen   investors   switch   between   mutual   funds   as  
they   would   switch   between   their   browsing   tabs.   Switching   is   essentially  
redeeming   the   units   from   'Fund   A'   to   invest   in   'Fund   B',   for   no   real   reasons.   In  
my   opinion,   this   cannot   be   packaged   as   long   term   investing.   The   true  
definition   of   long   term   investing   is   staying   invested   in   a   fund   across   a  
multi-year   period   (and   across   multiple   market   cycles).   Of   course,   occasionally  
there   will   be   justifiable   reasons   for   you   to   switch   between   funds,   we   will  
identify   these   reasons   at   a   later   point.    
Headline   investing    -   Most   investors   get   carried   away   by   newspaper  
headlines.   A   headline   which   remotely   hints   at   'bearishness',   is   taken   way   too  
seriously   and   used   as   a   reason   to   exit   an   ongoing   mutual   fund   investments.  

I'm   guilty   of   doing   this   mistake   myself.   Back   in   2007,   I   pulled   out   of   a   fund  
that   was   doing   very   well   because   I   read   a   headline   saying   markets   are   likely  
to   go   down   shortly.   The   problem   here   is   not   just   with   the   withdrawal;   it   is  
actually   with   the   fact   that   you   are   breaking   an   ongoing   investment   journey.   I  
was   never   able   to   restart   this   investment.    
Trust   me;   you   will   do   far   better   than   most   of   the   investing   public   if   you  
understand   these   basic   points   which   make   a   big   diﬀerence   to   your   investing  
journey.   Here   is   how   my   investments   in   Mutual   funds   have   done   till   date   -   
 
These   are   all   regular   funds.   Unfortunately,   the   direct   fund   option   was   not  
available   back   in   the   days.   The   returns   would   have   been   better,   had   I   decided  
to   invest   in   the   same   fund,   direct   option.   I'm   in   the   process   to   transition   all  
my   regular   to   direct   funds.   Hopefully,   this   table   should   look   better   over   the  
next   decade   
🙂
   
Also,   I   think   three   large-cap   funds   in   my   portfolio   is   an   overkill,   and   perhaps   I  
should   look   at   replacing   at   least   two   of   these   funds   with   a   low-cost   index  
fund.   At   a   later   stage,   I'll   share   my   thoughts   on   this   topic   related   to   asset  
allocation   and   fund   diversification.   
We   will   now   proceed   to   understand   a   few   of   these   subcategories   of   equity  
mutual   funds.   
9.4   -   The   Equity   mutual   fund   subcategories   
zerodha.com/varsity    
101    

102    
Under   the   broad   classification   of   equity   funds,   there   are   nearly   ten  
subcategories.   As   you   may   have   noticed,   the   name   of   these   subcategories   is  
quite   descriptive   and   gives   out   a   general   idea   about   what   to   expect   from   such  
a   fund.   
Large-cap   fund    -   As   the   name   suggests,   a   large-cap   equity   fund   indicates  
that   the   fund   invests   predominantly   in   large-cap   stocks.   These   are   the   top  
100   companies   in   India,   with   the   largest   market   capitalisation.   The  
expectation   is   that   these   companies   are   also   market   leaders   in   the   industry  
they   belong   to.   These   companies   are   also   supposed   to   be   stable   and   safe.  
Examples   of   large-cap   stocks   include   companies   like   TCS,   Reliance,   Infosys,  
HDFC   Bank,   etc.    
Have   a   look   at   the   portfolio   of   one   of   the   large-cap   mutual   fund   schemes.  
This   is   the   portfolio   of   Axis   Bluechip   fund   -   
 
As   you   can   see,   the   portfolio   predominantly   contains   large-cap   stocks   (80%),  
invested   in   varying   proportions.   The   weight   assigned   to   each   stock   is   the   fund  
manager's   prerogative.   By   the   way,   you   may   be   interested   to   know   that   by  
regulation,   once   a   month,   the   AMC   is   supposed   to   disclose   the   portfolio  
zerodha.com/varsity    
102    

103    
details.   So   go   to   the   AMC's   website   and   lookup   for   any   fund   you   are   interested  
in,   and   you'll   find   the   portfolio   details   in   the   'statutory   disclosure',   section.   
Usually,   when   an   investor   decides   to   invest   in   a   large-cap   fund,   he   has   a   twin  
agenda   -   (1)   capital   appreciation   in   line   with   the   markets,   (2)   low   volatility.   By  
low   volatility   here,   I   mean   with   respect   to   small   and   mid-cap   funds.   
In   simple   words,   this   means   that   the   investor   is   looking   at   wealth   creation   but  
with   not   so   much   risk   to   his   capital.   Do   remember,   these   are   large-cap   stocks,  
meant   to   be   stable   hence   less   volatile.   Of   course,   by   virtue   of   investing   in   the  
stock   market   either   directly   or   via   a   mutual   fund,   the   capital   is   exposed   to  
volatility.   Like   I   mentioned   earlier,   the   only   antidote   to   volatility   is   time.   So   it  
goes   without   saying   that   you   need   to   stay   invested   for   a   long   period   to   factor  
in   the   volatility   and   generate   decent   returns.   
Here   is   a   look   at   how   the   top   large-cap   mutual   funds   have   performed   over   the  
last   ten   years.   I've   defined   'top',   by   considering   the   size   of   the   fund's   AUM.   I've  
taken   this   data   from   Moneycontrol   -   
 
The   key   point   to   note   here   is   the   positive   return   across   all   the   funds   against   a  
long   investment   horizon.   

Mid-cap/small   cap/large   &   midcap   funds   -    I   guess   the   names   are   quite   clear  
for   us   to   know   what   to   expect   from   the   fund.    
The   mid-cap   fund   predominantly   consists   of   mid-cap   stocks   and   the  
small-cap   funds   contain   small-cap   companies.   The   volatility   in   mid   and  
small-cap   stocks   is   quite   high.   Like   the   large-cap   stocks,   investment   in   these  
funds   should   be   long   term.   You   cannot   aﬀord   to   invest   on   a   short   term   basis  
in   these   funds.   For   example,   here   is   how   the   small   and   mid-cap   funds   have  
performed   over   the   last   two   years   -   
 
The   last   two   years   have   been   particularly   bad   for   the   small   and   mid-cap  
stocks,   and   this   is   evident   across   the   fund's   returns.   I'm   not   trying   to   say   that  
the   returns   across   all   two   years   or   three   years   (or   any   short   term   cycle)   will  
always   be   bad.   It   depends   on   the   market;   however,   for   a   common   man,   it   is  
nearly   impossible   to   time   the   market   and   calls   the   cycles.   Hence   when   we  
invest,   we   should   have   a   long   term   agenda,   or   at   least   have   the   intent   to   stay  
invested   for   the   long   term.   
Here   is   how   some   of   these   small   and   mid-caps   have   performed   over   the   last  
ten   years   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
104    

105    
 
All   the   funds   have   delivered   a   fairly   decent   positive   return.   Also,   notice   the  
ten-year   performance   of   small   and   mid-cap   funds   are   better   than   the 
large-cap   funds;   this   should   be   evident   to   you   because   small   and   mid-cap  
funds   are   more   volatile   compared   to   large-cap   funds.   
The   intent   behind   investing   in   either   of   these   funds   is   the   same   as   large-cap  
i.e.   wealth   creation   over   a   long   period.   However,   you   expect   a   return   much  
higher   than   a   large-cap   fund   (against   much   higher   volatility).   This   is   obvious  
because   the   fund   contains   companies   which   have   a   long   headroom   for  
growth.   As   the   company   grows,   so   would   the   returns.   
The    large   and   mid-cap   fund    is   a   cocktail   of   both   mid   and   large-cap   stocks.  
Unlike   an   exclusive   large/mid/small-cap   fund,   the   'large   &   mid'   cap   fund   is  
expected   to   have   35%   of   its   investment   in   large-cap   and   another   35%   in  
mid-cap   stocks.   For   example,   this    DSP   large   and   mid-cap   fund    has   stocks   like  
Infosys,   Airtel,   HDFC   Bank,   and   also,   stocks   like   Hexaware,   Hatsun   Agro,   and   V  
Guard.   Technically   the   fund   can   be   a   65%   large   (or   mid)   and   35%   mid   (or  
large)   cap   stocks.   The   extent   of   the   skew   depends   on   the   fund   manager.    
Since   the   large   and   mid-cap   fund   is   a   mixed   bag,   the   expectation   on   the  
return   front   is   slightly   higher   than   a   regular   large-cap   fund   but   lower   than   a  
small-cap   fund.   The   risk   is   higher   than   a   large-cap   fund   but   lower   compared  
to   mid   or   small-cap   fund.   Here   is   how   the   returns   for   small   and   mid-cap   stack  
up   for   the   last   ten   years   -   

By   the   way,   given   that   there   are   so   many   AMCs   and   therefore   so   many  
diﬀerent   funds   for   the   same   category,   how   would   one   narrow   down   on   a  
single   fund   to   invest   in?   Well,   this   is   a   diﬀerent   topic   altogether,   and   it  
involves   looking   at   various   parameters   on   risk,   returns,   performance,   and  
costs.   We   will   take   this   up   aer   we   finish   all   our   discussions   on   MF   categories.   
In   the   next   chapter,   we   will   discuss   the   remaining   few   Equity   subcategories  
and   then   move   to   debt.   

CHAPTER    10   
Equity   Scheme   (Part   2)   
 
10.1   -   Multicap   funds   
 
We   discussed   the   equity   scheme   and   a   few   of   its   subcategories   in   the  
previous   chapter.   We   will   take   that   discussion   forward   in   this   chapter.   
Next   up   is   the   multi-cap   funds.   As   the   name   implies,   a   multi-cap   fund   is   not  
bound   to   particular   market   capitalization.   The   fund   manager   is   free   to   pick  
stocks   from   the   entire   market   and   create   a   diversified   portfolio   (the  
diversification   is   mainly   in   terms   of   market   capitalization).   In   a   sense,   the  
fund   manager   is   chasing   opportunities   that   he   thinks   make   sense.   The   only  
mandate   for   a   multi-cap   fund   is   that   it   should   consist   of   65%   investments   in  
equity   and   related   instruments.   
Have   a   look   at   the   portfolio   of    SBI's   Multicap   fund    -

The   portfolio   contains   large-cap   stocks   like   HDFC   Bank   Ltd   to   a   relatively  
small   company   like   UFO   Moviez   Ltd.   Of   course,   the   investments   in   these  
stocks   are   of   varying   degrees;   this   is   the   Fund   manager's   call.   The   portfolio  
mix   in   terms   of   capitalization   is   also   dependent   on   the   fund   manager.   The  
portfolio   mix   for   SBI   multi-cap   fund   looks   like   this   -   
 

Now,   given   the   fact   that   the   fund   is   diversified   across   the   diﬀerent   market  
capitalization,   the   AMCs   tend   to   benchmark   multi-cap   funds   to   the   S&P   BSE  
500   index   or   the   NSE   500   index.   These   indices   are   broad   and   contain   the   top  
500   companies   by   market   capitalization.   
Given   the   fact   that   the   multi-cap   fund   has   a   mix   of   market   capitalization,   the  
return   expectation   is   on   the   higher   side.   The   higher   return   expectation   is   also  
associated   with   a   higher   risk.   Here   is   a   summary   of   the   returns   from   Multi   cap  
funds   for   10   years   -   
zerodha.com/varsity

111    
 
As   you   can   see,   the   returns   average   about   10   -   11%,   the   lowest   being   7.36%  
and   higher   is   around   16%.   
This   leads   us   to   an   interesting   point.   The   AMC   is   an   asset-gathering   machine.  
It   tries   to   attract   more   and   more   funds   to   its   schemes.   Imagine,   a   multi-cap  
fund   does   the   asset   gathering   part   very   well   and   gathers   a   ton   of   assets.   What  
do   you   think   will   happen   to   this   fund?   
zerodha.com/varsity    
111    

112    
Well,   as   the   asset   size   grows,   they   will   have   to   deploy   this   fund   into   stocks.  
Unfortunately,   in   the   Indian   stock   markets,   the   liquidity   in   the   small-cap  
space   is   not   much,   hence   the   fund   is   forced   to   invest   the   funds   in   large   and  
mid-cap   funds.   
Hence,   as   the   asset   base   grows,   a   Multi   cap   fund   tends   to   work   like   a   large  
and   mid-cap   fund.   This   probably   explains   why   the   SBI   Multicap   fund   (8.5K  
Crore   in   AUM)   has   nearly   70%   of   its   investments   in   large-cap   stocks.   
The   one   thing   you   need   to   keep   in   mind   when   investing   in   a   multi-cap   fund   is  
the   'fund   manager'   risk.   Since   the   fund   invests   in   stocks   across   the   spectrum,  
the   performance   is   largely   dependent   on   the   kind   of   stocks   and   the  
proportion   the   fund   manager   decides   to   invest.   
By   the   way,   in   my   opinion,   if   you   are   completely   new   to   mutual   funds   and  
don't   know   where   to   start   and   which   category   to   pick,   then   I'd   suggest   you  
start   with   a   multi-cap   fund.   Think   of   this   as   going   for   a   buﬀet   dinner,   where  
you   get   a   bit   of   everything.   
10.2   -   Focused   Funds   
We   have   discussed   a   few   equity   categories   by   now.   I   hope   you've   looked   at  
the   fact   sheet   and   portfolio   composition   of   some   of   the   funds.   If   you   have,  
then   one   thing   that   comes   across   quite   evidently   is   the   number   of   stocks   in  
the   portfolio.   It   is   very   common   for   equity   mutual   funds   to   have   a   large  
portfolio   size   (in   terms   of   the   number   of   stocks),   the   numbers   average   to  
about   60-70   stocks   in   a   typical   equity   portfolio.   
The   common   theory   is   that   the   higher   the   number   of   stocks,   the   lower   is   your  
risk   (and   of   course   the   return).   

A   focused   fund   does   things   diﬀerently.   The   focused   funds,   as   the   name  
suggests,   contains   a   maximum   of   30   stocks   in   the   portfolio,   thereby   creating   a  
concentrated   portfolio.   A   concentrated   portfolio   is   a   portfolio   with   few   stocks  
(max   30   in   this   case),   but   each   stock   is   picked   only   aer   rigorous   due  
diligence.   In   the   investment   world,   they   call   this   high   conviction   bets.   The  
average   number   of   stocks   in   focused   funds   is   about   25   and   if   I'm   not   wrong,  
JM   Financials's   focused   fund   is   perhaps   the   only   fund   with   just   about   11  
stocks.   They   call   this   fund   the   core   11.   Their   portfolio   looks   like   this   -   
 
Since   the   number   of   stocks   is   limited   in   a   focused   fund,   the   risk   and   return  
profile   of   the   focused   fund   changes   drastically   compared   to   other   equity  
mutual   funds.   As   you   can   imagine,   the   focused   funds   oﬀer   the   possibility   of   a  
higher   return   along   with   higher   risk.   
Have   a   look   at   the   return   profile   of   the   focused   mutual   fund   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
113    

114    
 
Over   the   last   ten   years,   the   returns   range   from   7.25%   on   the   lower   side   to  
16.75%   on   the   higher   side.   These   returns   should   give   you   a   sense   of   how   the  
risk   profile   of   the   focused   funds.   
I   like   to   think   of   a   focused   fund   as   a   poor   man's   'Portfolio   Management  
Services',   you   get   similar   returns   at   a   much   lower   cost   and   entry   criteria.   
This   also   leads   me   to   the   next   point   -   the   focused   fund   is   not   for   someone  
who   is   starting   his   or   her   mutual   fund   investment   journey.   I'm   saying   this  
because   the   focused   fund   will   be   a   lot   more   volatile   compared   to   a   diversified 
mutual   fund.   I   think   it   is   very   important   to   familiarize   oneself   with   the   volatile  
nature   of   these   investments   and   slowly   ease   up   to   the   idea   of   market-linked  
investments.   If   you   start   straight   away   with   Focused   funds,   I'm   afraid   this  
experience   will   be   a   bit   harsh   and   may   convince   you   to   never   look   at   MF   as   an  
zerodha.com/varsity    
114    

115    
investment   option.   I   think   a   focused   fund   will   be   a   great   addition   to   the  
mutual   fund   portfolio   at   a   slightly   mature   state   in   the   investment   journey.   
10.3   -   Dividend   yield   funds   
I   wish   there   were   a   diﬀerent   name   for   this   mutual   fund   category.   The   moment  
you   see   'dividend   yield'   as   a   part   of   the   fund's   name,   it   is   only   natural   to  
expect   that   the   mutual   fund   pays   out   regular   dividends   to   its   investors.  
However,   this   is   not   true   at   all.   A   dividend   yield   fund   (or   for   that   matter   any  
other   mutual   fund)   is   under   no   obligation   to   pay   out   a   dividend   to   its  
investors.   
Given   this,   why   do   you   think   a   dividend   yield   fund   is   called   a   dividend   yield  
fund?   Well,   the   name   is   representative   of   the   strategy   the   fund   follows.   The  
strategy   as   you   can   imagine   involves   investing   in   companies   that   payout  
(high)`   dividends   regularly.   
Dividend   yield   =   Dividend   paid   during   the   year/   stock   price   
For   example,   if   Infosys   trading   at   Rs.780/-   per   share   pays   a   dividend   of   Rs.22/-  
for   the   year,   then   Infosys's   dividend   yield   is   -   
=   22/780   
=    2.8%    
Here   is   SEBI's   definition   for   this   category   -   
 
zerodha.com/varsity    
115    

116    
As   you   can   see,   the   fund   is   predominantly   invested   i.e.   at   least   65%   in  
dividend-yielding   stocks.   There   are   two   aspects   to   this   -   
The   fund   invests   65%   of   the   corpus   in   dividend-yielding   stocks;   the   balance  
35%   is   open   for   other   investments,   which   means   that   this   portion   (35%)   may  
be   invested   in   non-dividend-yielding   stocks   
Ideally,   these   funds   should   invest   in   high   dividend-yielding   stocks.   So   one   has  
to   define   what   'high   dividend'   really   means.   The   lack   of   clear   definition   leads  
to   inconsistencies   in-stock   selection.   For   example,   a   fund   manager   simply  
states   that   high   dividend   yield   is   anything   greater   than   0.75%   and   another  
fund   manager   may   want   to   benchmark   it   against   the   indices   dividend   yield.   
For   example,   check   out   the   UTI   Dividend   yield   fund   -   
 
They   benchmark   themselves   to   the   Niy   Dividend   opportunity   50   indexes.  
The   fund's   portfolio,   as   you   can   imagine   consists   of   companies   which   are   well  
established   and   consistent   dividend-paying   -   

117    
 
The   last   ten-year   performance   of   dividend   yield   funds   are   as   follows   -   
As   you   can   see,   the   performance   is   fairly   standard   across   these   funds.   
I'm   personally   not   a   big   fan   of   dividend   yield   fund   simply   because   I   prefer   to  
take   that   extra   risk   with   growth   stocks.   Of   course,   the   decision   to   invest   or   not  
to   invest   depends   on   the   portfolio   goals   of   the   individual.   

10.3   -   ELSS   Funds   
The   'Equity-linked   Savings   Scheme'   or   the   ELSS   funds   are   a   special   category  
of   mutual   funds   that   enjoy   tax   exemption   on   investments   made   under  
section   80C   of   the   Indian   Income-tax   Act,   1961.   
As   you   may   be   aware,   section   80C   in   the   income   tax   act   allows   you   to   reduce  
your   tax   burden   by   accommodating   for   certain   investments   and   payments  
made   during   the   financial   year,   the   reduction   in   the   tax   burden,   however,   is  
up   to   Rs.1,50,000/-   per   year.   
For   example,   if   you   have   a   total   gross   yearly   income   of   Rs.1,200,000/-   then  
you   can   choose   to   invest   Rs.1,50,000/-   in   various   80C   options   and   reduce   the  
tax   burden.   If   you   do   so,   your   taxable   income   reduces   to   1,050,000/-.   
Amongst   the   various   investment   options   permitted   under   section   80C,  
investments   in   ELSS   mutual   fund   is   one   of   them.   You   can   choose   to   invest  
either   the   entire   permitted   amount   of   Rs.1,50,000/-   in   ELSS   or   split   this  
amount   across   many   diﬀerent   schemes   such   as   Life   Insurance,   Public  
Provident   Fund,   five   year   FD,   Sukanya   Smariddi   Yojana,   etc.   
The   decision   to   do   so   depends   on   your   overall   financial   planning   strategy.   Of  
course,   we   will   discuss   this   more   as   we   progress   in   this   module.   
Here   is   how   SEBI   describes   an   ELSS   fund   -   
 
There   are   two   important   things   to   note   here   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
118    

119    
ELSS   funds   have   a   mandatory   lock-in   of   3   years.   I   guess   this   the   Government's  
way   of   inculcating   long   term   investing   behavior   
🙂
   
ELSS   funds   have   a   mandate   to   invest   80%   of   the   funds   in   equity   and  
equity-related   instruments.   There   is   no   restriction   on   the   market  
capitalization   of   stocks.   
Many   people   wrongly   assume   that   ELSS   funds   are   a   proxy   for   a   pure   large-cap  
fund   but   this   is   not   entirely   true.   ELSS   mutual   fund,   in   general,   can   probably  
be   considered   as   a   proxy   for   a   multi-cap   fund.   The   data   below   helps   you  
understand   this   -   
 
zerodha.com/varsity    
119    

120    
That's   the   list   of   the   40   top   ELSS   funds   and   as   you   can   see,   23   funds   have   less  
than   70%   in   large-cap   stocks   and   17   of   them   have   over   70%   invested   in  
large-cap   stocks.   Some   of   the   funds   like   the   IDFC   Tax   Advantage   Fund   have   a  
fairly   decent   mix   across   all   market   capitalization,   which   makes   it   a   clean  
multi-cap   fund.   
Again,   when   you   select   an   ELSS   fund,   the   decision   should   depend   on   your  
overall   portfolio   structure.   For   example,   there   is   no   point   in   having   a  
large-cap   fund   and   again   opting   to   invest   in   a   fund   like   HDFC   Taxsaver,  
because   HDFC   Taxsaver   has   83%   invested   in   the   large-cap   stock.   
The   performance   of   ELSS   funds   for   the   last   ten   years   is   as   follows   -   
zerodha.com/varsity

121    
 
These   are   for   a   few   of   the   top   funds   in   terms   of   AUM.   As   you   can   see,   the 
returns   average   about   11-12%,   which   I   think   is   in   line   with   the   multi-cap   fund.   
I   think   the   last   two   chapters   have   laid   down   a   brief   introduction   to   equity  
mutual   funds.   We   will   now   proceed   to   understand   the   basics   of   debt   funds  
and   cover   as   many   subcategories   as   possible.   Once   we   are   through   with   this,  
we   will   proceed   to   understand   the   techniques   of   selecting   a   mutual   fund   and  
building   a   mutual   fund   portfolio.   
All   of   this   and   more   in   the   coming   few   chapters.   So   stay   tuned   for   more

The   key   takeaway   from   this   chapter    
● A   multi-cap   fund   does   not   have   any   restrictions   on   where   it  
can   invest.   The   manager   invests   in   any   stocks   across   market  
caps   (large,   mid,   and   small)   where   he   sees   opportunities.   
● One   of   the   risks   to   watch   out   for   in   a   multi-cap   fund   is   the  
'fund   manager   risk.'   
● A   focused   fund   consists   of   not   more   than   30   stocks   in   its  
portfolio.   These   are   high   conviction   bets   by   the   fund   manager   
● The   risk   and   return   of   a   focused   fund   is   higher   compared   to  
any   other   equity   oriented   fund   
● A   dividend   yield   fund   does   not   mean   the   fund   pays   regular  
dividends   to   its   investors   
● The   dividend   yield   fund   invests   in   high   dividend-yielding  
stocks   
● ELSS   funds   are   tax   saving   funds   under   section   80C   of   the  
Indian   Income   Tax   act   1961   
● A   maximum   investment   of   1,50,000/-   is   permitted   under 
● An   ELSS   fund   is   considered   a   proxy   for   a   multi-cap   fund   

CHAPTER    11   
The   Debt   Funds   (Part   1)   
 
11.1   -   The   origins   of   debt   
Over   the   next   couple   of   chapters,   we   will   cover   the   basics   of   debt  
mutual   funds.   As   you   may   recollect   from   the   earlier   chapters,   there  
are   about   16   debt   mutual   fund   categories.   I   don't   intend   to   discuss  
all   these   categories   of   a   mutual   fund,   because   a   typical   investor  
does   not   need   these   many   categories   of   debt   investment.   Instead,  
I'll   discuss   the   following   which   I   think   are   essential   -   
1. Liquid   funds   
2. Overnight   funds   
3. Ultrashort   term   funds   
4. Medium   duration   
5. Dynamic   bonds   
6. Corporate   bond   
7. Credit   Risk   
8. Banking   &   PSU   
9. GILT   funds   2   different   types)   
In   my   opinion,   this   is   a   fairly   exhaustive   list   and   will   cover   many  
different   investment   situations   which   may   arise.   However,   if   you  
would   like   to   know   more   about   a   category   which   isn't   discussed  
here,   then   please   do   post   a   comment   and   I'll   be   happy   to   give   you  
clarifications   in   the   comment   section.   

The   debt-oriented,   liquid,   and   overnight   funds   together   constitute  
nearly   50%   of   the   27   lakh   crore   assets   under   management   AUM   in  
the   mutual   fund   industry   (as   of   Jan   2020.   So   as   you   can   imagine,  
this   is   a   relatively   large   chunk   of   investor   money.   The   debt   funds  
play   an   essential   role   in   the   investor's   portfolio,   and   it   serves   a  
variety   of   purposes,   including   capital   protection.   
Before   we   understand   how   and   when   to   use   a   debt   fund,   we   need  
to   understand   a   more   fundamental   concept,   i.e.   the   origin   of   debt.  
To   help   you   understand   this,   I'll   take   the   example   of   a   simple   debt  
structure,   which   I   guess   we   all   would   have   come   across   directly   or  
indirectly   in   our   daily   lives.   
So   let's   get   started.   Assume   you   want   to   buy   an   apartment.   
  
You   do   your   research   and   shop   around   for   the   apartment   with   a  
checklist.   After   an   exhaustive   search,   you   eventually   circle   in   on  
your   dream   apartment.   The   apartment   comes   with   everything   that  
you   ever   wanted   -   swimming   pool,   clubhouse,   convention   centre,  
zerodha.com/varsity    
124    

125    
supermarket,   tennis   court,   and   everything   else   desirable.   The  
apartment   costs   you   a   sweet   1.5Cr,   all-inclusive.   You   have   40L  
stashed   away   in   your   bank,   which   suffices   as   the   down   payment.  
You   still   need   1.1Cr   to   fund   the   property   purchase.   How   will   you  
source   the   additional   fund?   
Chances   are,   you   will   approach   a   bank   and   request   for   a   loan.   The  
bank   evaluates   your   request   and   either   give   you   a   loan   or   denies  
the   loan.   Needless   to   say,   before   deciding   to   provide   you   with   a  
loan,   the   bank   will   do   a   ton   of   background   work   and   dig   up   every   bit  
of   information   about   you.   One   of   the   critical   inputs   for   the   bank   is  
your   credit   score   issued   by   agencies   such   as   CIBIL   or   Experian.   The  
credit   score   is   a   reflection   of   your   creditworthiness,   higher   the  
rating   the   better   it   is   for   you   and   of   course,   a   low   credit   score  
implies   no   loan   or   a   loan   at   an   exorbitant   interest   rate.   
So   let   us   just   assume   that   you   have   a   fantastic   credit   score   and   the  
bank   decides   to   give   you   a   loan   of   1.1Cr   against   your   apartment  
purchase.   The   details   of   your   loan   are   as   follows   -   
Credit   score:   850   
Amount   :   Rs.1,10,00,000/-   
Tenure:   10   years   or   120   months   
Interest   rate:   8.5%   
Total   interest   payable   :   Rs.53,66,129/-   
Total   payable   Int   +   Principal)   :   Rs.1,63,66,129/-   
Monthly   EMI   Rs.1,36,   384/-   

There   are   plenty   of   online   calculators   you   can   use   to   get   these  
details.   I've   used   the   one   available   on   Bajaj   Finserv   site.   Of   course,  
the   credit   score   is   arbitrary   here   
🙂
   
These   details,   along   with   a   bunch   of   terms   and   conditions   are  
printed   on   a   document.   A   stamp   paper   is   attached   with   stamp   duty  
paid,   and   the   document   is   registered.   Finally,   both   the   parties   sign  
off.   A   document   such   as   this   is   called   a   loan   agreement.   
Finally,   the   loan   amount   is   credited   from   the   bank   to   your   bank  
account.   The   apartment   will   remain   hypothecated   to   the   bank   till  
the   entire   loan   amount   is   repaid.   The   hypothecation   works   as  
backup   security   for   the   bank.   In   case   you   refuse   to   repay   the   loan,  
the   bank   can   sell   your   apartment   and   make   good   their   principal   and  
interest.   
From   the   bank's   perspective,   the   loan   is   a   'collateralised   loan',  
because   the   loan   is   secured   against   collateral,   i.e.   the   property   in  
this   case.   A   collateralised   loan   is   a   safer   bet   for   the   bank   as  
opposed   to   a   non-collateralised   loan.   
At   this   point,   I   want   you   to   recognise   how   a   debt   obligation   is  
created.   A   debt   obligation   is   created   when   a   person   needs   to   carry  
out   an   economic   activity   for   which   the   fund   requirement   is   far  
higher   than   what   is   available   to   him.   
Going   back   to   the   apartment   case,   assuming   things   go   smoothly,   on  
every   month,   for   the   next   ten   years   the   borrower   is   expected   to   pay  
back   a   sum   of,   i.e.   Rs.1,36,   384/-   to   the   bank.   The   regular   inflow   to  
the   bank   is   the   'cash   flow'.   

So   far,   so   good,   this   is   a   reasonably   simple   debt   structure   to   understand.   Let   us   now   shift   focus   on   
the   risk   involved   here.   By   risk,   I   mean   the   risk   involved   for   the   banker,   i.e.   the   lender.   What   do   you   
think   can   give   the   lender   sleepless   night?    
There   are   a   couple   of   things   that   can   go   wrong   -   
Cashflow   risk    -   The   borrower   can   skip   paying   a   couple   of   EMIs   and  
make   irregular   repayments.   Irregular   repayments   mean   that   the  
bank   will   take   a   hit   on   the   expected   cash   flow,   potentially   leading   to  
a   chain   of   undesirable   events    
Default   risk    -   The   borrower   may   get   into   an   insolvent   situation  
wherein   servicing   the   loan   becomes   very   difficult;   hence   the  
borrower   decides   not   to   repay.   This   is   called   'default'   or   the   'default  
risk'.    
Interest   rate   risk    -   The   loan   is   given   out   at   a   specific   interest   rate.  
However,   the   economic   situation   may   change,   and   the   interest   rates  
may   drop   in   the   future.   This   means   that   the   bank   will   be   forced   to  
reduce   the   rates,   and   hence   the   expected   cash   flow   takes   a   hit.    
Credit   rating   risk   -    The   bank   evaluates   the   borrower's   credit   rating  
at   the   time   of   giving   out   the   loan.   At   this   point,   the   borrower's   credit  
rating   could   be   excellent.   However,   for   whatever   reasons,   the   credit  
rating   of   the   borrower   can   suddenly   degrade,   thereby   increasing 
the   chance   of   default   risk.    
Asset   risk   -    In   case   the   borrower   defaults,   the   bank   has   the   right   to  
sell   the   hypothecated   property.   What   if   the   property   itself   loses   its  
value?   This   is   a   double   whammy   situation   for   the   lender   or   the   bank.  
The   bank   loses   both   the   principal   and   the   asset.

128    
These   are   the   most   common   risk   associated   with   a   debt   obligation.  
We   have   taken   the   example   of   a   bank   and   an   individual,   the   same  
can   be   extended   to   corporates   as   well.   
Imagine   a   manufacturing   company   wants   to   build   a   new   plant.   The  
company   needs   about   INR   800   Crores   to   commission   this   plant.  
How   can   they   raise   this   money?   There   are   two   ways   the   company  
can   raise   this   money   -   
Approach   a   bank   and   seak   a   loan,   pretty   much   like   the   apartment  
case   we   discussed   
Instead   of   a   bank,   the   company   can   choose   to   raise   a   smaller  
amount   of   money   from   several   people   (investors).   Say   in   multiples  
of   20Crs.   The   company,   instead   of   paying   interest   to   the   bank,   now  
pays   the   interest   amount   to   multiple   investors.   
If   the   company   takes   the   1stapproach   and   seeks   a   loan   from   the  
bank,   then   the   binding   agreement   is   called   the   'loan   agreement'.   On  
the   other   hand,   if   the   company   decides   to   raise   this   money   from  
multiple   investors   (multiple   lenders),   then   the   binding   agreement   is  
called   ' bond '.    
Think   of   a   bond   as   a   promissory   note   from   the   company   to   its  
investors/lenders   promising   to   repay   the   principal   amount   at   the  
end   of   the   tenure   and   a   periodic   interest   amount,   also   called   a  
coupon.   
I   agree   this   is   a   rather   crude   and   unconventional   way   to   introduce  
the   concept   of   'bond'   to   you,   but   I   hope   you   get   the   point.   A   bond   is  
a   debt   product   wherein   the   lender   with   surplus   capital   provides  
capital   to   the   borrower   who   requires   the   capital.   In   exchange   for   the  
zerodha.com/varsity    
128    

129    
money,   the   borrower   promises   to   pay   interest   (coupon   payments)  
and   repay   the   full   principal   at   the   end   of   the   tenure.   
As   simple   as   that.   
The   risks   that   we   discussed   in   the   bank-apartment   example   applies  
to   bonds   as   well.   Three   risks   matter   the   most   when   it   comes   to   the  
bonds   -   
Credit   risk   
Interest   rate   risk   
Price   risk   
At   this   point,   if   you've   managed   to   understand   what   a   bond   is,   the  
risk   applicable   (very   briefly)   then   I   suppose   we   are   off   to   an  
excellent   start   to   learn   more   about   the   debt   funds.   
Remember   this   though   -   debt   funds   and   the   functioning   of   debt  
funds   is   one   thing   and   investing   (or   trading)   the   bond   is   another  
thing.   You   as   mutual   fund   investors   should   only   be   concerned   about  
three   things   -   
When   to   invest   in   a   debt   fund   and   how   to   choose   one?   
What   a   particular   category   of   debt   fund   does 
The   risk   associated   with   that   category   of   debt   fund   
The   fund   manager   of   the   debt   fund   should   be   concerned   about  
investing   or   trading   in   the   bond   market.   
The   bond   market   is   a   reasonably   big   market,   not   just   in   India   but 
across   the   world.   Companies   often   issue   bonds   to   full   fill   their  
zerodha.com/varsity    
129    

130    
capital   requirements   and   these   bonds   are   subscribed   by   the  
investors.   
The   mutual   fund   companies   which   have   the   capital   subscribe   to  
bonds   issued   by   the   companies   which   have   a   capital   requirement.   
With   this   background,   let's   start   discussing   the   different   categories  
of   debt   funds.   
11.2   -   The   liquid   fund   
The   liquid   fund   is   perhaps   the   most   popular   debt   fund   within   the  
debt   fund   universe.   A   liquid   fund   makes   investments   in   debt  
products   which   have   a   maximum   maturity   of   up   to   91   days.   
In   simple   words,   the   liquid   fund   invests   in   debt   obligations,   wherein  
the   borrower   promises   to   repay   the   borrowed   money   (principal)  
within   91   days   (maturity)   of   such   borrowing.   
Here   is   a   typical   example   -   Power   Finance   Corporation   PFC   of  
India   needs   150   Crs   to   fund   its   working   capital   requirement.   They  
agree   to   repay   the   borrowed   amount   to   the   lender   within   50   days.  
PFC   agrees   to   pay   8.5%   interest   (also   referred   to   as   the   coupon)  
against   this   borrowing.   
HDFC   AMC   has   150Cr   to   invest;   they   see   this   as   an   excellent  
opportunity   to   earn   8.5%   interest;   hence   they   give   the   funds   to   PFC.   
The   deal   is   done. 
After   50   days,   PFC   repays   150Cr   to   HDFC   AMC   along   with   8.5%  
interest.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
130    

131    
Note,   when   any   interest   or   coupon   rate   is   quoted,   it   is   quoted   on   an  
annual   basis.   So   this   is   8.5%   for   the   365   days.   For   50   days,   interest  
on   a   pro-rata   basis   is   - 
=   50   *   8.5%/365   
=    1.164%    
So   HDFC   AMC   will   get   back   150   Cr   +   1.746Cr   back   from   PFC.   
I   suppose   this   is   a   relatively   simple   deal   to   understand.   
Like   I   mentioned   earlier,   a   liquid   fund   by   regulation   can   invest   in  
debt   which   has   a   maximum   maturity   of   91   days.   When   a   corporate  
entity   borrows   for   such   short   term   basis,   they   do   so   by   issuing  
something   called   as   a   ' commercial   paper '   or   Cps.   In   the   arbitrary  
PFC   example   I   used,   PFC   is   deemed   to   have   issued   a   50   day   CP,  
which   was   subscribed   by   HDFC   AMC.    
The   Government   too   borrows   on   a   short   term   basis   to   fund   its   short  
term   financial   needs.   However,   when   the   Government   borrows,   it  
does   not   issue   a   CP   but   instead   issues   a    treasury   bill .   The  
Government   has   three   variants   of   t-bills   -    
1. 91-day   TBills,   the   maturity   of   91   days   
2. 182-day   TBill,   the   maturity   of   182   days   
3. 365   day   T-bills,   the   maturity   of   365   days   
You   can   read   more   about   the   treasury   bills   or   the   TBills    here .    
Now,   place   yourself   as   a   lender,   someone   with   surplus   capital.   You  
are   looking   for   an   opportunity   to   invest   100   Crs.   There   are   two  
possible   borrowers,   both   wanting   100Crs   each   -   

A   sugar   manufacturer   willing   to   offer   6.5%   coupon   
The   Govt   of   India   provides   a   6.5%   coupon   
Whom   would   you   lend?   This   is   a   no   brainer;   you'd   give   to   the   Govt  
because   you   know   that   with   the   Government,   there   is   no   credit   risk.  
The   Govt   will   repay,   but   the   same   cannot   be   said   about   the   sugar  
manufacturer.   
Does   this   mean   that   the   sugar   manufacturer   will   never   get   the  
required   funds?   Yes,   as   long   as   the   sugar   manufacturer   offers   a  
coupon   equivalent   to   the   Govt,   it   will   be   hard   for   them   to   source   the  
fund.   The   lender   will   lend   if   he   is   compensated   for   credit   risk;   hence  
the   coupon   has   to   be   higher   than   the   equivalent   T-bill.   
So   in   this   case,   the   sugar   manufacturer   should   offer   say   7   or   8%.   
Let's   extend   this   thought.   Assume   there   are   two   sugar  
manufacturing   companies   -   
Company   A   with   an   impeccable   track   record.   It   is   in   business   for   25  
years,   profitable,   and   steady   cash   flows.   
Company   B,   five   years   of   operations,   breaking   even,   backed   by  
young   entrepreneurs.   
Both   need   100   Crs.   Both   offer   8%,   you   have   the   money,   whom  
would   you   lend?   
Company   A,   of   course,   because   company   A   has   a   better   financial  
history,   hence   lesser   probability   of   default.   
Does   that   mean,   Company   B   will   never   get   the   funds?   Of   course,  
they   will,   as   long   as   they   compensate   the   lender   for   the   additional  
credit   risk.   Hence   company   B   has   to   offer   something   like   10   of   11%.   

The   credit   rating   reveals   the   credit   risk   of   a   company.   The   credit  
rating   of   the   equivalent   to   an   individual's   CIBIL   score.   The   higher,  
the   better,   which   also   means   companies   with   higher   credit   rating  
can   borrow   money   by   offering   lower   coupons.   
In   its   portfolio,   the   liquid   fund   contains   several   CPs   and   T   bills,   while  
T   bills   are   relatively   safer,   CPs   aren't.   
This   leads   me   to   the   most   critical   point   about   liquid   funds.   
11.3   -   Why   liquid   fund?   
People   invest   in   liquid   funds   to   park   cash,   which   they   intend   to   use  
sometime   soon.   By   'sometime   soon',   I   mean   within   a   year   or   at   the  
most   within   a   year   and   a   half.   The   purpose   of   this   investment   is   to  
protect   the   capital,   use   it   in   its   entirety   for   the   purpose   planned.   So  
think   about   the   liquid   fund   as   a   parking   space   for   your   excess  
funds.   
Question   is   -   why   to   invest   in   a   liquid   fund   and   why   not   let   it   be   in   a  
bank's   savings   account.   Well,   people   opt   to   invest   in   a   liquid   fund 
because   the   liquid   fund   offers   a   slightly   higher   return   compared   to  
the   bank's   savings   account.   
The   problem,   however,   is   the   fact   that   the   liquid   fund   is   often  
pitched   as   a   better   than   a   savings   account   SA   or   the   fixed   deposit  
FD'.   This   is   not   true   at   all.   A   liquid   fund   may   offer   higher   than  
SA/FD   account,   but   also   comes   with   a   certain   amount   of   risk.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
133    

134    
To   put   this   in   perspective,   an   average   SB   account   rate   as   of   today  
Feb   2020   is   3.5%   to   4%   whereas   the   average   Liquid   fund   gives  
you   a   6%   return.   
However,   the   liquid   funds   consist   of   several   CPs,   which   are  
suspectable   to   credit   risk.   Here   is   the   snapshot   of   HDFC's   Liquid  
funds   -   
  
As   you   can   see,   HDFC   Liquid   Funds   has   several   CPs   its   portfolio.   Of  
course,   the   credit   ratings   of   the   issuer   of   these   CPs   are   all   good,  
but   then   things   change   quickly   in   the   markets.   A   downgrade   in   the  
issuer's   credit   rating   means   a   steep   cut   in   the   NAV   of   the   liquid  
fund.   
HDFC's   portfolio   also   has   Government   securities,   which   virtual  
consists   of   no   credit   risk,   thanks   to   the   implicit   sovereign   guarantee.   

135    
While   this   is   a   good   liquid   fund,   it   is   still   not   risk-free,   you   can   lose  
your   money   if   something   were   to   go   wrong,   which   is   not   the   case  
with   a   SA   or   FD.   
To   give   you   a   perspective   of   how   bad   things   can   go,   check   this   -   
  
This   is   the   NAV   graph   of   Taurus   AMC's   Liquid   fund.   The   NAV   fell  
close   to   7%   on   a   single   day   in   Feb   2017.   All   gains   were   wiped   off,  
and   in   fact,   the   investors   took   a   hit   on   their   investment   capital.   It  
took   almost   a   year   for   the   fund   to   recover   back   to   its   previous  
levels.   
The   reason   for   this   fall   was   that   Taurus   had   nearly   2000Cr   of   CPs  
issued   by   Ballarpur   Industries.   The   credit   rating   agencies  
downgraded   Ballarpur's   CPs,   and   that   translated   into   a   7%   vertical  
fall   in   NAV.   

Anyway,   I'd   suggest   you    read   this   news   article ,   and   I   think   it   puts   all  
the   discussion   we   have   had   till   now   in   some   perspective.    
So   if   you   are   investing   in   Liquid   funds,   you   need   to   be   aware   of   a  
few   things   -   
Invest   only   to   park   your   spare   cash   
Expect   a   return   slightly   higher   to   your   SA   account   
Liquid   fund   is   not   risk-free,   you   can   lose   money   when   you   invest   in  
it   
Choose   a   fund   which   has   relatively   less   default   risk   -   meaning   the  
liquid   fund   portfolio   should   have   a   higher   concentration   of  
Government   securities.   
I'll   stop   this   chapter   here.   In   the   next   chapter,   I'll   discuss   the   close  
cousin   of   the   liquid   fund,   i.e.   the   ultra   short   term   fund.   

Key   takeaways   from   this   chapter    
● When   a   corporate   entity   borrows   funds   (for   more   than  
one   year),   they   do   so   by   issuing   bonds   
● Corporate   borrowings   for   less   than   a   year   is   done   via  
the   issuance   of   a   commercial   paper   or   the   CPs   
● When   the   Government   borrows,   they   do   so   by   issuing 
a   treasury   bill   or   the   TBill   
● Against   the   borrowing,   the   borrower   pays   interest  
(coupon)   to   the   lender   
● The   lender   faces   multiple   risks   when   lending   funds   to  
the   borrower   
● Credit   risk   and   interest   rate   risk   is   the   primary   risk   for  
the   lender   
● Liquid   funds   invest   only   in   CPs   and   T   bills   with   a  
maximum   maturity   of   91   days   
● Liquid   fund   is   not   a   proxy   for   a   savings   bank   account;  
it   carries   credit   risk.   

CHAPTER    12   
The   Debt   Funds   (Part   2)   
 
12.1   -   Overnight   Fund   
We   are   in   living   in   strange   times,   as   I   write   this,   the   market   is   down  
nearly   30%   from   its   peak.   I've   seen   markets   get   hammered   for   a  
variety   of   reasons   -   recessions,   business   cyclicality,   fraud,   political  
unrest,   civil   unrest,   geopolitical   tensions,   wars,   and   heck   even  
family   feuds.   But   never   in   my   wildest   dreams   could   I   imagine   the  
markets   getting   trashed   owing   to   a   virus   of   an   unknown   origin.   
I   guess   with   COVID   19,   we   have   seen   it   all.   At   least,   I   hope   so   :).   
Nevertheless,   we   have   to   do   what   we   have   to   do.   So   let   us   get   back  
to   the   debt   funds.   
  
zerodha.com/varsity

139    
In   the   previous   chapter,   we   introduced   the   concept   of   a   bond   or   a  
debt   structure   and   discussed   the   first   debt   mutual   fund,   i.e.   the  
liquid   fund.   Do   recall;   the   liquid   fund   is   not   risk-free   as   most   people  
assume,   it   is   susceptible   to   both   default   and   credit   rating   risk.   The  
Taurus   MF   and   Ballarpur   example   highlighted   this   credit   risk   in   liquid  
funds.   
Both   these   risk   types   are   significantly   reduced   (not   eliminated)   in   an  
overnight   debt   fund.   Remember,   a   liquid   fund   invests   in   papers  
maturing   up   to   91   days,   this   typically   includes   both   the   corporate  
commercial   papers   and   the   Govt's   treasury   bills.   
An   overnight   fund,   on   the   other   hand,   invests   in   securities   which  
have   one-day   maturity.   Think   of   this   as   lending   money   to   someone  
for   one   day   only.   So   at   the   start   of   the   day,   the   Fund   manager   of   an  
overnight   Fund   lends   to   'someone'   which   is   recovered   back   in   24  
hours.   
This   is   precisely   what   happens   in   an   'overnight   debt   mutual   fund'.   
Given   the   fact   that   the   overnight   fund   invests   (or   lends)   to   1-day  
debt   obligation,   the   chance   of   a   change   in   credit   rating   risk   is   low.  
The   default   risk   still   exists,   although   it   is   small.   
The   next   obvious   question   is   -   who   are   these   overnight   fund   lending  
to?   Well,   the   overnight   loan   happens   to   an   RBI   regulated   money  
market   instrument   called   'Tri   party   Repo'   or   the   'TREPS'.   
I'll   not   get   into   the   details   of   what   a   TREP   is   and   its   purpose,   I   think  
that   will   stray   us   from   the   main   focus   of   this   chapter.   All   you   need   to  
know   is   that   a   TREP   is   a   relatively   safe   instrument   wherein   the   act  
zerodha.com/varsity    
139    

140    
of   lending   and   borrowing   happens   over   a   24hr   window.   You   can  
read   more   about   TREPs   here   -   -  
https://www.ccilindia.com/FAQ/Pages/TREPS.aspx#1    
I   want   you   to   look   at   the   portfolio   of   HDFC   Overnight   Fund   -   
  
As   you   can   see,   the   entire   portfolio   consists   of   only   one   instrument,  
i.e.   the   TREP.   Have   a   look   at   the   portfolio   of   the   UTI's   overnight   fund  
-   
  
Again,   100%   of   the   fund   invests   in   TREP   only.   
This   leads   us   to   an   important   conclusion   -   as   every   overnight   fund  
invests   in   TREP   instrument,   there   is   no   difference   between   the  
overnight   fund   A   and   overnight   Fund   B.   They   all   tend   to   put   up   the  
same   performance.   The   only   difference   is   because   of   the   difference  
in   the   expense   ratio.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
140    



141    
Of   course,   we   have   not   discussed   the   expense   ratio,   yet   in   this  
module,   we   will   in   the   coming   chapter.   
So   who   would   want   to   invest   in   an   overnight   fund?   Well,   this   is   an  
ideal   fund   for   anyone   looking   at   parking   funds   for   a   short   term  
duration.   By   short   term,   I   mean   for   less   than   three   months.  
Remember,   if   you   want   to   park   funds   for   more   than   three   months   or  
90   days,   you   are   better   off   looking   at   a   liquid   fund.   
It   is   futile   to   look   at   the   return   aspect   of   an   overnight   fund.   It   does  
not   make   sense,   because   you   don't   invest   in   an   overnight   fund   to  
chase   'returns',   you   do   for   the   sake   of   convenience.   
However,   if   you   are   interested,   as   of   today,   overnight   funds   yield  
around   45%   annualized.   So   you   can   do   the   math   on   a   pro-rata  
basis.   
12.2   -   Ultra-short   duration   Fund   
Next   up   is   the   ultra   short   term   debt   mutual   fund.   Things   in   the   debt  
mutual   fund   start   getting   interesting   from   now.   
Think   of   yourself   as   a   debt   mutual   fund   manager.   Your   job   as   a   fund  
manager   is   to   find   investments   opportunities   in   the   debt   market.  
You   can   do   so   by   investing   the   scheme's   corpus   in   new   bond/CP  
issues,   or   you   can   choose   to   buy   these   bonds   from   the   secondary  
bond   market.   
Think   of   this   as   buying   a   stock   at   the   IPO   or   buying   it   post   the   IPO  
from   the   stock   exchanges.   Now,   the   moment   you   buy   it   from   the  
zerodha.com/varsity    
141    

142    
secondary   market,   the   price   of   the   bond   will   (may)   differ   from   the  
first   issue   price.   
Why   would   the   price   vary?   Well,   for   a   host   of   reasons   including   the  
demand   and   supply   dynamics   of   the   bond.   
Each   time   a   bond   is   purchased,   the   bond   manager   expects   a  
periodic   coupon   (interest)   payment   during   the   tenure   of   the   bond  
and   at   the   end   of   the   tenure,   the   principal   to   be   repaid.   
Let   us   hold   on   to   this   thought   for   a   moment.   We   will   get   back   to   this  
thread   in   a   bit.   
Think   of   another   case.   Your   best   friend   needs   Rs.10,000/-.   He  
approaches   you   for   it   and   promises   to   repay   within   a   year.   You  
decide   to   give   him   this   money,   interest-free.   
Now,   how   long   does   it   take   for   you   to   recover   back   your   money?  
The   time   taken   to   get   back   your   money   is   a   year.   It   was   easy   to  
evaluate   the   time   taken   because   there   is   no   other   cash   flow   in   the  
form   of   interest   repayment.   
On   the   other   hand,   if   there   was   an   additional   cash   flow   in   terms   of   a  
coupon   payment,   paid   every   three   months,   then   what   do   you   think  
would   be   the   time   taken   to   recover   the   money?   
While   pinpointing   to   the   exact   number   can   be   a   bit   tricky,   intuition  
says   that   the   time   taken   to   recover   the   money   is   little   lower   than   a  
full   year,   because   there   is   cash   flow.   Do   note;   you   can   do   some  
math   and   get   the   exact   time   to   recover   the   money,   but   let's   not   get  
there.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
142    

143    
The   point   to   note   is   -   in   the   presence   of   cash   flow,   the   time   to  
recover   the   principal   is   lesser.   
With   this   point,   let's   go   back   to   the   previous   thread.   
Fund   manager    A    subscribes   to   a   bond   at   issuance.   The  
specifications   are   as   follows   -    
Face   value   =   Rs.1000   
Coupon   =   8%   
Coupon   payment   frequency   =   Semi-annual   
Maturity   =   3   years   
Question    -   How   long   will   the   fund   manager   A   take   to   recover   the  
money   invested   in   this   bond?    
Answer    -   Intuition   says   that   it   could   be   a   little   lesser   than   three  
years.    
Fund   manager    B    buys   the   same   bond   from   the   secondary   market.  
Now,   we   know   that   the   bond   prices   fluctuate   in   the   market.   Assume  
the   fund   manager   B   pays   Rs.1020   for   the   same   bond.    
Question    -   How   long   will   the   fund   manager   take   to   recover   the 
money   invested   in   this   bond?    
Answer    -   Intuition   says   Fund   manager   B   will   take   slightly   higher  
time   to   recover   the   price   paid   for   the   bond   when   compared   to   fund  
manager   A.    
Fund   manager    C    buys   the   same   bond   from   the   secondary   market.  
Assume   the   fund   manager   pays   Rs.980   for   the   same   bond.

Question    -   How   long   will   the   fund   manager   take   to   recover   the 
money   invested   in   this   bond?    
Answer    -   Intuition   says   Fund   manager   C   will   take   lesser   time   to  
recover   the   price   paid   for   the   bond   when   compared   to   Fund  
manager   A.    
I'm   trying   to   make   two   points   here   -   
Bond   price   fluctuates   
Based   on   the   price   paid,   the   time   to   recover   the   invested   amount  
varies.   
There   is   an   exact   science   to   estimate   the   time   to   recover,   that   is   an  
integral   part   of   the   bond   math.   The   metric,   'time   to   recover',   is   called  
' Macaulay's   Duration   of   a   Bond '.    
Why   is   'Macaulay   Duration'   essential   and   why   are   we   discussing  
that?   Well,   have   a   look   at   how   SEBI   defines   the   characteristics   of   an  
ultra-short   duration   fund   -   
  
According   to   this   definition,   an   Ultra   Short   duration   fund   can   invest  
in   short   maturity   bills   and   CPs,   which   has   a   maturity   between   3  
month   and   six   months   90   to   180   days).   
zerodha.com/varsity    
144

An   important   point   to   note   here   is   that   SEBI   specifies   this   at   a  
portfolio   level   and   not   restricted   to   an   individual   bill   or   CP.   What   this  
means   is   that   the   fund   can   buy   CPs   with   a   maturity   of   fewer   than  
90   days   or   maybe   more   than   180   days,   they   can   even   invest   in  
TREPS,   but   at   an   overall   portfolio   level,   the   fund   has   to   ensure   that  
the   Macaulay   duration   of   the   entire   portfolio   falls   within   3   to   6  
months.   
To   give   you   a   perspective,   have   a   look   at   the   portfolio   of   DSP's  
Ultra-short   duration   fund   -   
  
The   bulk   of   the   ultra-short   duration   fund   is   invested   in   money  
market   instruments;   the   maturity   ranges   anywhere   between   1   day   to  
365   days.   Mostly   these   are   CPs   belonging   to   various   corporate  
entities,   here   is   a   snapshot   of   their   money   market   portfolio   -   
  
They   also   hold   NCDs   and   Bonds   NCDs   and   bonds   are   the   same),  
which   have   a   maturity   of   at   least   a   year   -   

The   job   of   the   fund   manager   is   to   ensure   that   they   not   only   manage  
the   returns   but   also   manage   the   Macaulay   duration   of   the   entire  
portfolio   such   that   they   adhere   to   the   SEBI   specified   norm.   
There   is   another   interesting   point   to   note   here   -   while   the   ratings   of  
CPs   kind   of   vary   for   the   money   market   instruments,   they   are   all  
triple-A   for   Bonds   and   NCDs.   Triple   AAA   ratings   imply   that   the  
probability   of   default   is   lower.   
As   the   maturity   of   the   bond   increases,   the   bond   manager   is   more  
worried   about   possible   default   in   the   bond.   Hence,   they   tend   to  
stick   AAA   rate   bonds.   
However,   this   leads   us   to   a   critical   point   concerning   ultra-short  
duration   funds   -   they   are   not   risk-free.   These   funds   too,   have   the  
risk   of   credit   default   and   rating   downgrade.   
Given   this,   who   should   invest   in   an   ultra-short   duration   fund?   
I   think   that   this   is   a   good   fund   for   anyone   looking   to   park   money   for  
12   years,   plus   they   are   ok   to   take   a   wee   bit   of   risk   on   the   parked  
capital.   If   you   can   make   peace   with   the   fact   that   on   the   downside  
your   money   can   go   down   by   a   few   percentage   points,   then   go  
ahead   and   park   your   funds   in   this   ultra   short   term   funds.   
zerodha.com/varsity

147    
If   you   are   looking   at   parking   money   for   lesser   than   a   year,   stick   to   a  
liquid   fund   instead.   
On   the   return   side,   I   think   it   is   reasonable   to   expect   a   return   close   to  
the   bank's   fixed   deposit.   
12.3   -   Franklin   and   Vodafone   saga   
Since   we   are   talking   about   Ultra-short   duration   bonds,   I   guess   it  
makes   sense   to   quickly   discuss   the   Franklin   -   Vodafone   drama   that  
unfolded   earlier   this   year.   
Franklin   India   had   invested   in   Vodafone   India   Limited   VIL's   debt  
papers   across   six   different   debt   schemes,   including   its   Ultra  
short-duration   bond   fund.   
In   Oct   2019,   the   Supreme   Court   of   India   passed   a   judgement   in  
favour   of   the   Dept   of   Telecom   (Dot),   in   a   case   against   DoT   and   the  
telecom   operators.   As   a   result   of   the   Supreme   Court's   judgement,  
the   operators   were   asked   to   pay   the   licence   fee   and   the   spectrum  
usage   charge   based   on   the   Adjusted   Gross   Revenue   AGR.   
If   you   are   not   familiar   with   this,   then   I'd   suggest   you   read   this   short  
note   from   the   good   folks   at   Finshots,   they   have   done   a   great   job   at  
explaining   the   AGR   episode  
- https://finshots.in/archive/the-final-verdict-on-agr-2/    
Anyway,   to   cut   a   long   story   short,   post   this   judgement,   VIL   was   now  
expected   to   Rs.27,000   Crs   to   DoT   towards   unpaid   dues.   
This   means   VIL   would   be   cash   squeezed;   hence   they   are   likely   to  
default   on   their   debt   obligations.   

148    
As   a   smart   money   manager,   after   all,   sorts   of   ramification   of   this  
judgement,   Franklin   India   took   a   proactive   step,   and   they   themself  
internally   downgraded   the   VIL's   papers   to   junk   status   and   wrote   off  
that   investment.   
To   give   you   a   perspective,   Franklin   India's   Ultra-short   bond   fund   had  
4.2%   of   its   portfolio   invested   in   VIL's   paper.   Now,   what   do   you   think  
happens   when   you   4.2%   of   your   portfolio   is   rendered   useless?   
Obviously,   the   NAV   of   the   fund   falls.   Check   this   -   
  
In   my   view,   Franklin   may   take   at   least   a   year   or   year   and   a   half   to  
get   back   to   the   previous   NAV   levels.   The   only   reason   I'm   discussing  
the   Franklin   and   Vodafone   issue   is   to   make   you   understand   that  
debt   funds   too   are   risky,   invest   in   them   only   after   you   fully  
understand   the   risk   involved.   

I'll   stop   this   chapter   at   this   stage.   Before   I   wrap   this   up,   I'd   like   to  
give   you   a   quick   insight   into   the   direction   we   are   heading   with   this  
module.   
So   far,   we   have   discussed   Equity   mutual   and   few   debt   funds.   The  
discussion   is   restricted   mainly   to   a   brief   introduction   to   these   funds  
and   what   happens   within   these   funds.   In   the   next   chapter,   we   will  
continue   this   and   introduce   a   few   other   debt   funds   and   probably  
wind   up   the   introduction   bit.   
Once   we   are   through   with   that,   we   will   start   with   the   fund   analysis  
bit   and   figure   how   to   select   mutual   funds,   both   debt   and   equity   and  
slowly   steer   our   way   in   building   a   goal-based   mutual   fund   portfolio.   
So,   we   have   a   long   way   to   go.   Stay   tuned   and   stay   safe!   
Key   takeaways   from   this   chapter   
● Overnight   funds   invest   in   debt   instruments   with   a   24hr  
settlement   cycle   
● Almost   all   overnight   funds   invest   in   Tri   party   repo   
● The   performance   across   overnight   funds   is   similar   
● Macaulay   Duration   of   a   fund   gives   us   a   sense   of   how  
long   it   takes   for   the   fund   to   get   back   its   invested  
amount   
● Ultra-short   duration   fund   has   a   Macaulay   duration 
between   3   to   6   months   
● Ultrashort   duration   funds   are   also   risky   

CHAPTER    13   
The   Debt   Funds   (Part   3)   
 
13.1   -   Debt   jargons   
As   we   enter   the   27th   day   of   the   nationwide   lockdown,   I   hope   you   and   your  
loved   ones   are   staying   home,   staying   safe.   The   number   of   COVID19   cases   in  
India   has   crossed   17,000   with   Maharashtra   topping   the   charts   with   over   3,500  
cases.   I   hope   all   of   this   ends   soon   and   we   can   all   get   back   to   our   normal   lives,  
until   then   the   only   mantra   is   'social   distancing',   I   hope   you   are   following   this  
diligently.   
I   think   many   people   across   the   country   are   using   the   lockdown   opportunity  
to   learn   something   new   and   educated   themselves.   The   traﬀic   on   Varsity   has  
shot   up   quite   a   bit,   here   is   the   pageview   snapshot   from   Google   Analytics   -   
 
Along   with   the   pageview,    the   number   of   queries   pouring   in   has   also   shot   up.  
We   spend   several   hours   every   day   to   answer   your   questions.   

So   if   you   find   the   new   chapter   update   a   bit   slow,   then   please   do   understand  
its   because   of   the   increased   load   
🙂
   
In   the   previous   chapter,   we   introduced   a   term   called   'Macaulay   Duration'.   If  
you   recollect,   Macaulay   duration   measure   in   years,   the   time   required   for   the  
bondholder   to   recover   the   price   paid   for   the   bond   by   the   bond's   cash   flow.   We  
did   not   discuss   the   math   behind   Macaulay   duration   because   that's   outside  
the   scope,   but   as   I   hinted   in   the   previous   chapter,   the   next   module   is   on   fixed  
income   security   (mini-series)   where   I'll   try   and   take   this   up   in   detail.   
However,   while   we   cruise   along,   there   are   few   bond   relationships   that   you  
need   to   know   -   
The   yield   of   a   bond   and   the   price   of   the   bond   are   inversely   proportional.   If   the  
price   of   the   bond   increases,   the   yield   of   the   bond   decreases   and   vice   versa   
zerodha.com/varsity    
151    

152    
Interest   rates   and   bond   price   are   inversely   proportional.   If   the   interest   rates  
increase,   the   bond   price   reduces   and   vice   versa.   
While   we   are   at   it,   let   me   introduce   another   term   -   '   Modified   Duration',   of   the  
bond.   
The   modified   duration   (measured   in   years)   of   a   bond   is   essentially   the  
sensitivity   of   the   bond's   price   to   the   change   in   interest   rate.   So   if   a   bond   has   a 
modified   duration   of   3.2   years,   then   -   
A   1%   increase   in   interest   rate   decreases   the   bond's   price   by   3.2%.   A   1.5%  
increase   in   the   interest   rate,   lower   the   bond's   price   by   4.8%   
A   1%   decrease   in   interest   rate   increases   the   bond's   price   by   3.2%.   A   1.5%  
decrease   in   bond   price,   increases   the   bond's   price   by   4.8%   
We   can   generalize   this   -   Higher   duration   funds   have   a   higher   sensitivity   to  
interest   rate   changes.   So   a   1%   change   in   interest   rate   reduced   the   price   of   a  
longer   duration   fund   in   a   greater   magnitude   compared   to   a   low   duration   fund  
and   vice   versa.   
In   the   context   of   a   mutual   debt   fund,   the   modified   duration   is   at   an   aggregate  
portfolio   level.   In   the   example   above,   say   for   a   1.5%   increase   in   the   interest 
rate,   the   debt   fund's   NAV   is   likely   to   decrease   by   4.8%.   I   hope   you   get   the   dri.   
As   a   debt   mutual   fund   investor,   you   are   in   the   right   spot   if   you   are   aware   of  
the   few   points   we   have   discussed   so   far.   Along   with   these   few   points,   as   a  
bondholder   or   a   debt   mutual   fund   holder,   you   need   to   be   aware   that   the  
mutual   fund   you   are   holding   is   susceptible   to   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
152    

153    
Credit   risk   -   The   risk   that   the   bond   held   by   the   debt   fund   can   get   downgraded   
Default   risk   -   The   risk   that   the   bond   issuer   defaults   on   a   coupon   or   principal  
repayment   
Of   course,   now   you   also   know   that   the   bond   price   has   an   interest   rate   risk, 
but   at   this   point,   let   us   just   assume   the   fund   manager   can   hedge   the   interest  
rate   risk.   
Anyway,   we   will   get   back   to   the   good   old   debt   mutual   funds.   In   this   chapter,  
we   will   continue   our   discussion   and   take   a   few   more   debt   (sub)   categories.  
We   will   start   the   conversation   with   the   low   duration,   money   market,   and  
short-duration   funds.   
13.2   -   Low   duration   and   Money   Market   
We   looked   at   the   ultra-short   duration   bond   fund   in   the   previous   chapter.   The  
defining   criterion   for   the   ultra-short   duration   fund   was   the   Macaulay   duration  
of   the   portfolio.   As   per   SEBI's   classification,   at   the   aggregate   portfolio   level,  
the   Macaulay   duration   of   the   ultra   short   term   duration   fund   has   to   vary  
between   three   to   six   months.   
Next   up   is   the   low   duration   fund.   The   low   duration   fund   is   just   like   the  
ultra-short   duration,   only   that   the   low   duration   fund,   the    Macaulay   duration  
at   the   aggregate   portfolio   level   varies   between   six   to   twelve   months.   
The   credit   risk   of   the   low   duration   fund   is   similar   to   the   ultra-short   duration  
fund.   Hence   it   is   imperative   for   the   investors   to   glance   through   the   asset  
quality   (paper   quality)   of   the   fund.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
153    

154    
Have   a   look   at   the   portfolio   of   the   IDFC   AMC's   low   duration   fund   -   
 
As   you   can   see,   IDFC   has   100%   of   its   portfolio   invested   across   various   AAA  
papers.   However,   just   because   the   fund   has   only   AAA   papers,   does   not   imply  
zero   credit   risk.   Remember,   we   discussed   the   Vodafone   case   in   the   previous  
chapter.   
While   the   credit   risk   exists,   the   interest   rate   risk   for   the   low   duration   fund   is  
low.   Have   a   look   at   the   modified   duration   of   IDFC's   Low   duration   fund  
(published   in   the   fund's   factsheet)   -   
 
The   modified   duration   is   289   days.   I   can   convert   this   to   years   by   dividing   this  
by   360   -   
=   289/360   
zerodha.com/varsity    
154    

155    
=   0.802   
This   means   to   say   for   every   1%   increase   or   decrease   in   the   interest   rate,   and  
the   NAV   is   likely   to   decrease/increase   by   0.802%,   which   as   you   can   imagine   is  
not   much.   
By   the   way,   not   all   funds   report   modified   duration   in   terms   of   the   number   of  
days.   Modified   duration   is   expressed   in   terms   of   years.   
For   example,   the   Nippon   India   low   duration   fund   expresses   the   modified  
duration   in   years,   which   is   0.94   yrs.   
 
zerodha.com/varsity    
155    

156    
So   when   the   fund   expresses   in   years,   you   need   not   divide   by   360.   Instead,   you  
can   use   the   number   directly.   
While   we   are   at   it,   which   of   the   two   low   duration   funds   do   you   think   is   risky   in  
terms   of   modified   duration?   
IDFC's   Low   duration   Fund   with   a   modified   duration   of   0.802   or   Nippon   India's  
low   duration   fund   with   a   modified   duration   of   0.94?   
Here   is   a   task   for   you   -   why   do   you   think   Nippon   India's   low   duration   fund   has  
a   higher   modified   duration?   Can   you   look   into   their   portfolio   (as   of   April   2020)  
and   get   your   answer?   
If   you   can   answer   these   questions   with   ease,   then   we   are   headed   on   the   right  
track

Lastly,   who   should   look   at   investing   in   a   low   duration   fund?   This   is   best   suited  
under   situations   where   you   want   to   park   your   money   for   a   short   duration   and  
utilize   the   funds   towards   a   specific   goal   at   a   later   point.   
Next   up   is   the   money   market   fund.   
The   money   market   fund   is   somewhat   similar   to   the   low   duration   fund.   Here   is  
SEBI's   classification   of   the   money   market   fund   -   
 
As   you   can   see,   the   maturity   is   capped   to   one   year,   similar   to   that   of   low  
duration   fund;   the   only   diﬀerence   is   in   terms   of   the   portfolio   constituents.   

A   low   duration   fund   can   invest   in   both   money   market   instruments   and   bonds  
but   ensure   at   the   aggregate   portfolio   level   the   duration   is   between   6-12  
months.   The   money   market   fund,   however,   can   invest   only   in   money   market  
instruments.   The   money   market   instruments   usually   consist   -   
'Commercial   Papers'   or   CPs,   issued   by   companies.   CPs   are   unsecured   
'Certificate   of   Deposits'   or   CDs.   Banks   issue   CDs   to   entities   depositing   money   
T-Bills,   issued   by   the   Government,   carries   a   sovereign   guarantee.   
So   just   to   summarize,   the   fund   manager   of   a   low   duration   fund   can   invest   in  
CPs,   CDs,   and   perhaps   even   in   a   bond   with   two   years   maturity.   However,   a  
money   market   fund   manager   can   only   invest   in   CDs   and   CPs.   
Let   me   ask   you   two   question   -   
What   is   the   risk   of   investing   in   a   money   market   fund?   
What   do   you   think   will   be   the   modified   duration   of   a   money   market   fund?   Will  
it   be   1,   greater   than   one   or   less   than   1.   
Do   pause   here,   think   about   it,   try   to   answer   yourself.   

 
You   will   find   the   answers   for   both   the   questions   here.   
The   money   market   fund   is   exposed   to   credit   risk.   As   you   can   see,   9.39%   of   the  
portfolio   is   invested   in   a   single   company's   CP   or   CD.   Of   course,   the   company's  
paper   enjoys   a   high   rating,   but   I   want   you   to   remember   the   fact   that   these  
ratings   can   change.   So   yeah,   credit   risk   exists   in   a   money   market   fund.   
As   you   may   have   guessed,   the   modified   duration   will   be   under   one   year   for   a  
money   market   fund,   which   implies   that   the   interest   rate   risk   for   these   funds   is  
low.   
Investment   philosophy   in   the   money   market   fund   is   similar   to   the   low  
duration   fund.   In   fact,   many   investors   oen   choose   between   low   duration   and  
the   money   market   fund.   

13.3   -   Short   Duration   and   Medium   Duration   funds   
Next   up   is   the   short   duration   fund.   Let's   start   straight   with   SEBI's   definition   -   
 
The   Macaulay's   duration   of   the   short   duration   fund   has   to   range   between   1  
and   3   years.   Aer   reading   the   SEBI   definition,   what   is   the   first   thing   that  
comes   to   your   mind?   
Well,   I   hope   you   think   about   it   from   a   risk   perspective.   With   an   increase   in   the 
duration,   the   modified   duration   also   increases   -   which   means   the   risk  
associated   with   changes   in   interest   rate   is   higher   with   a   short   duration   fund  
(and   the   medium   duration   fund).    Do   note;   this   was   not   so   much   of   a   concern  
with   the   low   duration   and   money   market   fund   (or   even   the   ultra-short  
duration   fund).   
Of   course,   credit   risk   continues   for   short   duration   fund   as   well.   Have   a   look   at  
the   rating   profile   of   the   Mirae   Asset   Short   Term   Fund   -   

 
As   you   can   see,   the   fund   has   a   mix   of   AAA,   AA   and   A1+   debt   papers   in   the  
portfolio.   For   the   same   fund,   look   at   the   modified   duration   -   
 
The   modified   duration   is   2.67   years,   which   means,   for   every   1%   increase   in  
the   interest   rate,   the   fund   will   drop   2.67%   in   its   NAV.   The   risk   associated   with  
the   short-term   fund   is   higher   compared   to   all   the   other   funds   we   have  
discussed   so   far.   
Also,   do   notice   the   Macaulay   duration   of   the   fund,   it   is   below   3,   as   SEBI   has  
defined.   
With   a   considerable   amount   of   risk,   you   need   to   be   clear   with   your  
investment   objective   in   these   funds.   Invest   in   these   funds   only   if   you   have   an  
zerodha.com/varsity    
160    

161    
investment   horizon   of   at   least   three   years   in   perspective.   Of   course,   with   the  
increased   risk,   the   return   expectation   is   also   higher.   I   think   it   is   prudent   to  
expect   about   7   (ish)   %   return   on   these   short-duration   funds.   
I   think   by   now,   you   must   have   got   the   hang   of   how   to   understand   the   basics  
of   debt   fund.   
Here   is   the   SEBI's   classification   of   a   Medium   duration   fund   -   
 
As   a   task,   why   don't   you   do   look   upon   a   fact   sheet   belonging   to   a   medium  
duration   fund   and   answer   these   question   -   
How   is   the   portfolio   composition?   What   do   they   hold   in   the   portfolio?   How  
are   the   papers   rated?   
What   do   you   this   is   the   credit   risk   here?   
What   is   the   Macaulay   duration?   Does   it   match   SEBI's   mandate?   
What   is   the   modified   duration?   What   do   you   think   is   the   risk   associated   with  
the   interest   rate   change?   
What   is   your   investment   horizon   if   you   were   to   invest   in   these   funds?   

I'm   reasonably   sure   that   you   can   carry   out   the   above   task   with   ease.   If   you  

In   the   next   chapter,   we   will   take   up   the   Credit   risk,   dynamic   bonds   and   the  
gilts.   However,   there   is   one   last   thing   we   need   to   discuss   before   we   end   this  
chapter.   
13.4   -   The    Franklin   India   debt   fund   saga   
On   23rd   April   2020,   Franklin   Templeton   (India)   AMC   made   an   announcement  
that   shook   the   entire   debt   fund   world.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
162    

163    
 
In   an   unprecedented   move,   Franklin   has   decided   to   close   six   of   its   debt   funds,  
which   includes   their   low   duration   fund   and   ultra-short   duration   fund.   The  
AUM   across   these   six   funds   is   roughly   Rs.27,000   Crores.   
The   reason   they   cite   is   -   because   of   the   current   economic   situation,   there   is   a  
surge   in   redemption,   leading   to   a   liquidity   crunch   within   the   AMC.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
163    

164    
To   put   this   in   perspective,   Franklin   witnessed   a   surge   in   redemption   to   the  
extent   of   over   Rs.9000   Crores   in   March   2020,   which   as   you   can   imagine   is  
one-third   of   the   AUM   across   these   funds.   
Unfortunately,   the   secondary   bond   market   in   India   is   not   liquid   enough.   It   is  
not   easy   for   the   fund   managers   to   quickly   liquidate   the   bonds   from   their  
portfolio.   For   this   reason,   most   of   the   bonds   held   to   maturity.   Of   course,   the  
AMC   plans   to   have   enough   cash   to   meet   daily   redemptions,   they   do   this   in  
several   ways,   including   a   technique   called   laddering,   wherein   they   have   a  
blend   of   papers   maturing   in   diﬀerent   timelines.   The   liquidity   arrangements  
work   when   business   functions   as   usual.   But   as   we   clearly   understand   now,  
things   go   helter-skelter   when   tables   turn.   
None   of   the   AMCs   would   be   (at   least   up   until   now)   prepared   for   such   a   steep  
surge   in   redemption.   
Hence   to   ease   the   situation,   Franklin   has   decided   to   close   down   the   schemes  
completely   and   lockdown   the   funds   entirely,   which   implies   that   if   you   are   an  
investor   in   these   funds,   then   you   cannot   place   a   redemption   request.   
Please   note,   the   AMC   is   not   winding   down   the   scheme   because   of   the   credit  
or   interest   rate   risk.   Folks   at   Franklin   are   outstanding   in   the   debt   fund   game,  
and   they   have   vast   experience   in   this   segment,   but   unfortunately,   they   are  
now   threading   on   a   diﬀerent   territory.   
Therefore,   dear   readers,   when   investing   in   debt   funds,   along   with   the   credit  
and   interest   rate   risk,   factor   in   a   new   risk   -   liquidity   risk.   

165    
But   of   course,   how   do   you   quantify   and   apply   liquidity   risk   in   a   real-life  
scenario?   Well,   I   don't   know   that   just   yet.   However,   does   this   mean   that   you  
should   completely   stay   away   from   debt   funds?   
No,   not   at   all.   
Debt   funds   play   an   essential   role   in   asset   allocation,   and   it   should   play   its  
part   in   your   portfolio.   The   COVID19   situation,   if   not   for   anything,   has   yet   again  
highlighted   the   importance   of   asset   allocation.   

CHAPTER    14   
The   Debt   Funds   (Part   4)   
14.1   -   Liquidity   Risk   
In   the   previous   chapter,   we   discussed   the   Franklin   debt   fund   saga.   Thanks   to  
this   episode,   as   investors,   we   now   very   clearly   know   that   investing   in   debt  
fund   should   not   be   based   on   useless   parameters   such   as   the   past   returns   or  
the   current   fund   ranking.   The   market   has   taught   us   one   two   many   times   that  
this   approach   to   fund   selection   is   a   pointless   aﬀair.   
The   evaluation   must   be   based   on   risk   metrics.   Unless   the   investor   develops   a  
sense   of   all   the   risk   involved   while   investing   in   a   debt   fund,   he   or   she   should  
not   even   venture   into   the   debt   fund   arena.    The   same   holds   for   equity   funds  
as   well.   However,   thanks   to   the   tagline   'Mutual   funds   are   subjected   to   market  
risk',   investors   somehow   perceive   market   risk   as   a   risk   associated   (only)   with  
equity   funds.   Still,   at   least   they   are   aware   of   the   fact   that   equity   funds   are  
risky.   
Unfortunately,   the   same   set   of   people   assume   that   the   debt   funds   do   not  
carry   any   risk.   
If   you   have   read   the   previous   chapters,   you   know   that   debt   funds   are   risky  
too,   and   you   are   even   familiar   with   the   risk   types   associated   with   debt   funds,  
i.e.   default   risk,   credit   risk,   and   the   interest   rate   risk.   The   recent   Franklin  
episode   formally   introduced   us   to   another   dormant   risk   factor   called   the  
'Liquidity   Risk'.   

 
We   will   start   this   chapter   with   a   quick   discussion   on   liquidity   risk   and   then  
proceed   to   learn   the   other   categories   (sub)   of   debt   funds.   
Liquidity   risk,   from   the   debt   fund   perspective,   can   mean   two   things   -   
● The   lack   of   liquidity   in   the   underlying   market   the   debt   funds   invests   in,  
i.e.   the   Indian   bond   markets.   
● The   lack   of   availability   of   funds   with   the   AMCs   to   service   investor's  
redemption   
Both   these   are   tightly   related   though.   
The   lack   of   liquidity   in   the   bond   market   implies   that   the   AMCs   cannot   quickly  
liquidate   the   papers   they   hold   in   the   bond   market,   which   means   to   say   that  
they   are   obligated   to   keep   the   paper   to   maturity,   which   further   implies   that  
the   money   is   kind   of   'locked-in'.   

Now   the   primary   job   of   an   AMC   is   to   collect   money   from   an   investor,   invest  
that   money   on   their   behalf,   generate   returns   for   the   investors,   and   return   the  
funds   when   the   investor   redeems   the   units.   
To   honour   the   investor's   redemption,   the   AMC   must   hold   enough   cash   across  
each   of   the   schemes.   If   the   AMC   does   not   have   enough   funds,   then   they  
cannot   service   the   redemption   requests   that   come   in,   especially   in   case   the  
redemption   requests   come   in   large   numbers.   
Think   about   it   for   a   second   -   on   the   one   hand;   the   AMC   has   invested   in   debt  
papers   which   it   cannot   sell   as   and   when   they   wish   (lack   of   liquidity   in   bonds  
market)   and   on   the   other   hand,   it   has   to   maintain   a   cash   pile   to   service  
redemptions.   In   the   event   redemption   comes   in   large   numbers,   the   lack   of  
cash   causes   a   liquidity   crisis.   
Franklin   India   faced   this   same   situation.   One   a   day   to   day   basis,   AMCs  
maintain   enough   cash   to   service   redemptions,   aer   all,   redemptions   are   a  
regular   aﬀair   for   an   AMCs.   
However,   if   there   is   a   surge   in   redemption,   then   the   AMC   will   need   extra   cash  
to   service   the   redemption.   Question   is   where   they   will   get   this   money?   
You   guessed   it   right,   they   borrow.   
Under   SEBI's   guidelines,   an   AMC   can   borrow   up   to   20%   of   its   net   asset   under  
management   (AUM).   You   can   read   the   detailed   directions    here    - 
Here   is   the   extract   on   AMC's   borrowing   limits   -   

So,   if   an   AMC   is   pulling   this   lever   to   borrow   funds,   then   it   probably   indicates  
that   the   AMC's   usual   cash   pile   is   depleting;   hence   they   need   to   borrow   more  
to   service   redemption   request.   
How   do   we   get   to   know   if   the   AMC    is   borrowing?   Well,   one   needs   to   look   at  
the   monthly   portfolio   declaration   that   the   AMC   makes.   If   the   cash   component  
is   positive,   that   means   to   say   that   the   AMC   is   not   borrowing   funds,   if   it   is  
negative,   then   that   shows   the   presence   of   debt.   

As   you   can   see,   the   cash   component   turned   negative   in   March   2020,   which  
means   to   say   that   the   AMC   had   borrowed   funds,   showing   some   early   signs   of  
liquidity   stress.   Franklin   folded   this   particular   fund   along   with   five   others   on  
23rd   April   2020.   So   there   was   some   warning   on   the   wall.   
There   are   a   couple   of   things   to   note   here   -   
● Just   because   you   see   a   negative   cash   value,   do   not   jump   into   the  
conclusion   that   the   fund   is   about   to   go   bust.   Develop   a   sense   to  
connect   the   dots   to   understand   what   is   happening.   
● The   negative   cash   component   can   be   a   lagging   indicator   -   remember  
the   AMC's   portfolio   details   comes   out   with   a   delay;   nevertheless,   this   is  
still   a   good   indicator   of   trouble.   
So   if   you   are   a   'do   it   yourself'   investor,   then   do   keep   an   eye   on   this   every  
month.   The   onus   is   on   you   to   figure   the   development   in   the   market   and  
connect   these   dots.    What   do   I   mean   by   'connect   the   dots'?   Could   I   connect  
the   dots   and   developed   a   foresight   into   what   would   happen   to   Franklin   in  
March   itself?   
These   are   tough   questions   to   answer.   Today,   I   have   the   benefit   of   hindsight,  
and   therefore   I   can   lay   down   a   list   of   things   -   
● Franklin's   Vodafone   episode   was   the   first   warning   sign.   
zerodha.com/varsity

● The   individual   portfolios   consisted   of   papers   below   AA+;   this   was  
always   questionable.   
● Cash   decreased,   borrowings   increased.   
● The   market   itself   was   weak,   thanks   to   COVID   19   
● The   street   sentiment   was   negative.   
When   you   connect   these   things,   you'd   somehow   see   trouble   brewing.   I  
understand   it   may   not   be   straightforward   for   a   regular   investor   (or   for   that  
matter   even   seasoned   analysts),   with   more   market   experience   the   'connect  
the   dots'   bit   becomes   more   intuitive   and   the   call   will   eventually   come   from  
your   gut   
🙂
   
We   will   discuss   more   on   this   and   other   aspects   of   risk   in   the   'how   to   select  
mutual   funds',   chapter.   We   will   now   proceed   to   understand   three   diﬀerent  
types   of   debt   funds   -   Banking   &   PSU   Debt   Funds,   Credit   risk   funds,   and   the  
Gilts.   
14.2   -   Banking   and   PSU   Debt   Fund   
Ideally,   I'd   have   stopped   discussing   debt   funds   right   aer   the   medium  
duration   funds,   because   in   my   opinion,   all   the   other   types   of   debt   funds   are  
entirely   pointless   for   a   typical   retail   portfolio.   
However,   I   think   it   is   important   to   discuss   other   debt   fund   types   to   let   you  
know   what   they   are   and   what   to   expect.   
Let   us   kick   start   this   discussion   with   the    Banking   &   PSU   Debt   Funds.   
zerodha.com/varsity

Before   we   proceed,   think   about   this   a   bit   and   try   to   imagine   what   the  
'Banking   and   PSU   debt   Fund',   really   means.   
If   you   are   someone   like   me,   I'm   sure   you'd   have   thought   that   the   Banking   and  
PSU   debt   Fund,   as   the   name   suggests   is   a   fund   that   invests   in   papers   from   the  
banking   and   PSU   sector.   The   banking   and   PSU   sector   is   as   one   of   the   safest   in  
India.   
Fair   enough   now   let's   see   what   SEBI   has   to   say   -   
 
Well,   it   looks   like   we   were   almost   right   
🙂
   
The   fund   invests   in   banking   and   PSU   debt   to   the   extent   of   80%.   Pay   attention  
to   the   80%   part   here!   
The   remaining   20%   gets   invested   in   any   paper.   
Suddenly   what   seemed   like   a   harmless   debt   fund   turns   out   tricky.   
This   is   an   80-20   cocktail,   and   there   is   a   problem   with   it.   Think   about   this   from  
a   regular   retail   investor,   when   he   reads   the   fund's   title;   it   is   only   natural   for  
him   to   expect   the   fund   to   be   100%   Banking   and   PSU   debt,   he   would   not  
expect   the   fund   to   have   papers   from   the   private   sector.   
If   a   default   occurs   in   any   of   the   paper   from   the   20%   bucket,   then   the   fund's  
NAV   takes   a   hit.   Who   is   to   blame   here?   The   investor   for   expecting   a   pure-play  
Banking   &   PSU   fund,   the   fund   manager   for   lousy   investment,   or   SEBI   for  
permitting   this   cocktail?   

Have   a   look   at   IDFC   AMCs   Banking   &   PSU   Debt   Fund   -   
 
The   portfolio   consists   of   paper   from   Reliance   Industries   to   the   extent   of  
1.27%,   not   that   Reliance   is   terrible,   could   be   a   fantastic   paper   to   hold.   Still,  
the   question   is,   does   it   belong   here?   
   
Anyway,   the   good   part   of   the   Banking   and   PUS   Debt   fund   is   that   the   credit  
risk   is   kind   of   on   the   lower   side,   mainly   for   two   reasons   -   
● RBI   provides   liquidity   support   to   banks   and   NBFCs   
● Implicit   Sovereign   guarantee   by   the   Govt   of   India   for   PSUs   
But   remember,   the   'credit   risk   comfort'   is   for   80%   of   the   portfolio;   the   same   is  
not   valid   for   the   balance   of   20%   of   the   portfolio.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
173    

174    
Also,   if   you   notice,   SEBI   has   no   specs   on   the   Macaulay's   duration   of   the  
portfolio,   which   means   the   fund   manager   is   flexible   with   the   duration   of   the  
papers   held   in   the   portfolio.   Given   this,   the   modified   duration   will   be   on   the  
higher   side   for   these   funds.   
Here   are   the   parameters   for   the   IDFC's   Banking   &   PSU   Debt   fund   -   
 
The   average   duration   is   about   3.1   years,   which   is   in   line   with   any   mid   duration  
fund.   The   modified   duration   is   about   2.6,   which   for   a   debt   fund   is   on   the  
slightly   higher   end   of   the   spectrum.   If   the   interest   rate   goes   up,   the   fund   will  
take   quite   a   bit   of   time   to   recover   from   the   fallen   NAV.   
Given   this,   an   investor   looking   at   investing   in   these   debt   funds   should   have   at  
least   3-5   years   perspective   while   investing   in   the   Banking   &   PSU   Debt   fund.   
At   this   point,   I   think   it   is   important   to   remind   the   readers   that   so   far   in   this  
module,   we   are   only   introducing   diﬀerent   types   of   fund.   We   have   made   few  
passing   comments   on   some   of   these   categories,   but   we   still   haven't   figured  
how   and   why   one   should   invest   if   at   all   one   has   to.   
At   a   later   point   in   this   module,   we   will   try   and   figure   two   significant   bits   -   
● How   to   analyse   a   Mutual   Fund?   
● How   to   build   an   MF   portfolio?   
When   we   do   this   discussion,   we   will   tie   all   loose   ends   and   develop   a   holistic  
approach   to   personal   finance.   

14.3   -   Credit   Risk   Funds   
Before   October   2017   (before   SEBI's   huge   MF   reclassification   circular),   Credit  
Risk   Funds   were   called   'Credit   Opportunities   Fund'.   
Do   you   notice   the   change   in   perception   here?   
Credit   Opportunity   Fund   -   the   emphasis   is   on   the   opportunity,   returns,   and  
generally   has   a   positive   feel   to   it,   hence   easier   to   sell   
🙂
   
Credit   Risk   Fund   -   It's   the   same   fund,   but   by   highlighting   the   term   risk,   the  
emphasis   is   on   the   risk,   and   rightly   so.   
Anyway,   the   name   'Credit   risk   fund',   should   give   you   a   heads   up   on   what   to  
expect   in   this   fund   
🙂
   
Yes,   you   guessed   it   right,   the   fund   is   loaded   with   Credit   Risk!   
As   usual,   let   us   start   with   SEBI's   definition   -   
 
And   if   you   are   wondering   what   the   little   circumflex   next   to   the   name   points   to  
-   
 
SEBI   here   simply   specifies   that   an   AMC   running   a   credit   risk   fund   should  
invest   65%   of   the   assets   in   corporate   bonds,   which   are   'below   are   below   the  
investment   grade,   which   means   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
175    

176    
● These   bonds   carry   maximum   credit   risk,   hence   the   probability   of   both,  
default   by   the   bond   issuer   and   credit   downgrade   is   very   high   
● No   spec   on   where   the   balance   35%   gets   invested   
The   Credit   risk   fund   is   where   the   fund   managers   cut   themselves   to   chase  
yields.   Think   of   it   like   a   hungry   kid   at   a   buﬀet   dinner   party.   The   plate   will   be  
loaded,   with   zero   control   on   what   gets   packed   in   the   plate.   
Similarly,   a   fund   manager   running   a   credit   risk   fund   loads   up   the   portfolio  
with   risky   papers   to   chase   yields.   Let   me   explain   this.   
The   objective   of   a   credit   risk   fund   is   to   take   on   as   much   credit   risk   as   possible  
to   ensure   a   higher   yield   to   the   investors.   What   does   this   mean?   
This   means   the   fund   will   lend   the   investor's   funds   to   corporates   whose  
repayment   track   record   or   repayment   capability   is   questionable.   Why   would  
the   fund   manager   deliberately   lend   to   a   corporate   who   is   unlikely   to   repay?   
He   does   so   because   the   corporates   in   need   of   the   fund   say,   'give   me   the  
money,   and   I'll   compensate   you   with   higher   interest   rates'.   
You   see   the   point,   right?   Corporate   with   bad   credit   history   has   to   entice   new  
lender   by   paying   a   higher   coupon   rate.   
The   debt   papers   of   such   corporates   usually   have   a   lower   rating.   When   the  
fund   manager   lends   to   such   entities,   he   hopes   for   the   following   -   
● The   borrowing   entity   will   repay   and   honour   the   interest   paid   regularly.   
● He   also   hopes   the   corporate   entity   improves   its   creditworthiness.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
176    

177    
● If   the   creditworthiness   improves,   then   the   rating   of   the   bond/paper   will  
improve.   
● If   the   ratings   improve,   the   bond   price   goes   up,   hence   the   NAV   increases   
If   these   things   were   to   happen,   not   only   will   the   fund   manager   get   higher  
interest   rates   for   the   money   he   has   lent,   but   will   benefit   from   the   credit   rating  
upgrade   and   the   eventual   increase   in   bond   prices.   
Let   us   look   at   a   portfolio   of   a   Credit   Risk   Fund;   this   belongs   to   DSP's   Credit  
Risk   fund   -   
 
The   fund   manager   here   has   decided   to   allocate   nearly   30%   of   its   assets   to   just  
one   company.   You   can   imagine   the   hit   on   the   NAV   of   this   fund   if   this   company  
were   to   default   on   its   obligation.   
The   credit   ratings   of   the   other   companies   are   not   excellent   either;   well,   this   is  
expected   from   a   credit   risk   fund.   Still,   the   combination   of   concentrated  
positions   coupled   with   lousy   credit   ratings   makes   this   a   hazardous   category  
to   invest.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
177    

178    
The   credit   risk   fund   is   a   complicated   category   to   understand,   but   the   good  
part   is   that   a   retail   investor   does   not   need   to   endure   this   pain.   
Almost   all   portfolio   goals   of   a   retail   investor   can   be   achieved   without    GILTS   in  
the   portfolio.   So   do   avoid   investing   your   money   in   a   credit   risk   fund.   
14.4   -   GILT   Funds   
Back   in   the   early   19th   Century,   when   the   Government   would   borrow   money,  
they   would   do   so   by   issuing   a   bond   (a   physical   paper),   on   which   the   terms   of  
the   borrowing   were   written   and   signed.   The   edges   of   such   a   bond   were   laced  
in   Gold,   to   showcase   the   sanctity   of   Government   borrowing.   Such   bonds  
issued   by   the   Government   were   called   the   'Gilt-edged   bonds',   because   of  
golden   edges.   
The   presence   of   Gold   does   not   eliminate   the   credit   or   interest   rate   risk,   at   the  
end   of   the   day,   this   technically   is   still   a   bond   
🙂
   
However,   the   fact   that   the   borrower   is   the   Government   implies   that   there   is  
virtually   zero   Credit   risk,   because,   well,   the   Government   cannot   default   on  
debt   obligations.   
The   legacy   continues,   and   even   today,   the   bonds   issued   by   the   Government   is  
called   a   GILT,   there   is   no   gold   lacing   today,   but   the   Sovereign   Guarantee   still  
exists.   
Now,   as   you   can   imagine,   a   mutual   fund   that   invests   predominantly   in  
Government   bonds   or   Gilts   is   called   a   'Gilt   Fund'.   
Here   is   SEBI's   definition   of   a   GILT   fund   -   
zerodha.com/varsity

 
There   are   two   types   of   GILT   funds   -   
● Gilt   funds   -   Invests   a   minimum   of   80%   of   its   assets   in   Government  
securities.   This   implies   20%   can   go   anywhere   (again   the   cocktail  
problem)   
● Gilt   with   ten-year   constant   duration   -   This   fund   is   the   same   as   above  
with   the   added   clause   that   the   Macaulay's   duration   is   at   least   ten   years.  
By   defining   the   duration,   the   entire   risk   profile   of   this   fund   changes.   
Agreed,   there   is   no   Credit   risk   for   the   investor   here.   We   expect   the  
Government   never   to   default.   But   think   about   the   interest   rate   risk   in   these  
funds,   especially   the   constant   duration   one.   As   you   can   imagine   the   interest  
rate   risk   is   quite   significant   in   these   funds,    probably   large   enough   to  
compensates   for   the   absence   of   credit   risk.   
I   would   urge   you   to   look   into   the   fact   sheet   of   any   GILT   fund   and   observe   the  
duration   and   modified   duration   to   get   a   sense   of   how   risky   these   funds   are.   
If   you   ever   decide   to   invest   in   these   funds,   then   do   so   only   with   a   long,   really  
long   term   perspective.   I'm   talking   about   8-10   year   time   frame   here.   
I   really   don't   see   a   need   for   a   GILT    fund   in   any   retail   portfolio;   you   are   better  
without   this.   

Anyway,   with   this,   we   will   wrap   up   our   discussion   on   debt   funds.   Up   next   is  
ETFs   and   Index   funds.   
Key   takeaways   from   this   chapter   
● A   debt   fund   investor   should   watch   out   for   liquidity   risk   
● The   cash   borrowings   of   a   fund   is   an   indicator   of   liquidity   risk   
● The   Banking   and   PSU   debt   funds   invest   predominantly   in  
banking/financial   services,   and   PSU   debt   
● The   banking   and   PSU   debt   carries   less   credit   risk   (relatively)  
compared   to   its   peers   
● Credit   risk   fund   carries   a   high   degree   of   credit   risk.   A   retail  
investor   is   better   oﬀ   avoiding   this   fund   
● GILTS   don't   have   credit   risk   but   have   a   significant   amount   of  
interest   rate   risk   

CHAPTER    15   
Investing   in   Bonds   
  
15.1   -   Context   
I   understand   we   concluded   the   previous   chapter   by   hinting   that   we   would  
discuss   Index   funds   next.   However,   I'm   taking   a   bit   of   a   detour   to   introduce  
how   one   can   invest   in   Bonds   directly.   
Why   am   'I   doing   this   now?   Well,   that   is   because   we   have   just   discussed   debts  
funds   and   the   associated   terms,   given   the   similarity   between   debt   funds   and  
bonds,   I   thought   we   could   extend   that   discussion   and   talk   about   bonds   as  
well.   
Besides,   Zerodha's   bond   investing   platform   is   up   and   ready   for   you   to   use,   so  
this   chapter   will   help   you   understand   how   to   use   the   platform   as   well.   
 

182    
Remember,   when   you   invest   in   any   sort   of   debt   mutual   fund,   you   primarily  
invest   in   a   mutual   fund   whose   fund   manager   invests   your   funds   in   various  
bonds   and   bills.   Using   Zerodha's   platform,   you   can   now   directly   invest   in   the  
bonds,   just   like   the   fund   manager   would.   
15.2   -   The   bonds   platform   
The   bonds   platform   on   Zerodha   is   a   part   of   Coin,   our   mutual   fund   platform.   
 
On   the   landing   page,   you   can   see   that   we   are   talking   about   high-quality   PSU  
and   Corporate   Bonds.   High   quality   here   means   the   highest   credit   ratings.   
At   any   given   point,   the   platform   lists   all   the   available   bonds   for   you   to   invest.  
As   of   today,   these   are   the   bonds   available   to   you   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
182    

183    
 
For   example,   the   very   first   is   a   bond   from   Rural   Electrification   Corporation  
Limited   (REC).   
 
There   are   two   tags   below   the   company's   name;   these   tags   give   you   vital  
information   on   the   bonds.   
● PSU   Tax-free    -   Remember,   PSUs   carry   an   implicit   Sovereign   guarantee; 
hence   the   credit   risk   in   these   PSU   bonds   is   very   low.   The   tax-free   bit  
indicates   that   the   interest   income   received   from   these   bonds   is   100%  
tax-exempt.   The   tax-free   bit   makes   these   bonds   extremely   attractive   for  
the   investors.   However,   the   tax-free   is   applicable   only   for   the   interest  
income.   If   you   hold   the   bond   till   maturity,   there   will   be   no   taxation   on  
zerodha.com/varsity    
183    

184    
your   interest   earnings   from   this   bond.   However,   if   you   manage   to   sell  
this   bond   before   maturity   at   a   price   more   than   what   you   had  
purchased,   then   you   get   capital   gains   which   are   taxable.   
● Credit   Rating    -   REC   Limited's   bond   is   rated   triple-A   (AAA)   by   CRISIL;   the  
rating   is   an   indication   of   the   creditworthiness   of   the   borrower.   AAA   is  
the   highest-ranking,   so   one   need   not   worry   about   the   creditworthiness  
of   the   borrower,   i.e.   REC   in   this   case.   
Apart   from   these   tags,   there   are   other   specs   available   to   you.   Some   of   these  
are   easy   and   intuitive,   while   the   others   are   not.   
 
On   the   platform,   you   can   see   a   summarized   view   of   the   most   important  
parameters   for   you   to   consider   before   investing.   A   typical   investor   does   not  
need   any   more   information   apart   from   what's   listed   above.   
However,   for   the   sake   of   this   chapter   and   its   completeness,    let's   dig   into  
more   details   of   this   particular   REC   bond.   The   ISIN   of   this   bond   is  
INE020B07HO1,   key   in   the    ISIN   here    and   you'll   get   all   the   other   information  
related   to   this   bond.   
I've   highlighted   the   most   significant   bits   here   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
184    



185    
 
Let's   start   with   the   first   item   from   the   le.   As   we   can   see,   this   is   a    secured  
debt .   A   secured   debt   is   a   loan   backed   by   security.   The   classic   example   is   a  
Gold   loan.   
In   a   gold   loan,   you   pledge   the   gold   and   raise   a   loan   against   it.   When   you   repay  
the   loan,   the   pledge   on   gold   goes   away,   and   you   get   back   the   gold.   In   case  
you   don't   repay   the   loan,   the   lender   is   free   to   take   your   gold   and   make   good  
for   his   loss.   
Given   this,   if   you   look   at   it   from   the   lender's   perspective,   a   secured   debt   gives  
the   lender   a   higher   comfort   compared   to   unsecured   debt.   
In   the   next   section,   you   can   see   that   this   is    senior    debt.   
Every   company   has   something   called   'Capital   Structure'.   The   capital   structure  
is   like   a   leader   board   of   sorts,   which   mandates   the   list   of   stakeholders   who  
have   the   highest   claim   on   the   company's   repayment   and   earning   structure.   
The   senior   secured   debt   sits   right   at   the   top   of   a   capital   structure,   while   a  
common   stock   (equities)   sits   right   at   last.   Between   the   senior   debt   and  
zerodha.com/varsity    
185    

186    
equity,   lie   other   stakeholders   like   the   unsecured   debt,   convertible   bonds,  
non-convertible   debt   etc.   In   case   of   liquidation   of   the   company   (worst   case  
scenario),   the   senior   debt   holders   are   the   first   ones   to   be   paid   oﬀ   from   the  
liquidation   amount   of   the   company.   This   significantly   enhances   the   safety   of  
capital   for   senior   debt   holders.   
So   the   moment   you   see   secured   senior   debt,   be   assured   that   the   credit   risk  
associated   is   relatively   very   low.   
The   section   aer   this   is   quite   self-explanatory,   talks   about   the   date   of   issue.  
Think   about   this   as   the   company's   IPO   date   or   an   NFO   debuting   in   the   MF  
market.   
REC   paper   was   issued   in   2013,   maturing   in   2023,   making   this   a   10-year   bond.   
Now   move   your   attention   to   the   details   mentioned   on   the   right   -   the  
topmost   section   details   out   a   few   essential   parameters.   
Firstly,   the   face   value,   which   is   Rs.1000/-.   The   face   value   of   a   bond   is   essential  
for   three   reasons   -   
1. Gives   you   a   sense   of   the   premium   or   discount   the   bond   is   trading   to   its  
face   value.   In   the   case   of   REC   (refer   to   the   snapshot   from   COIN),   the  
current   price   for   this   bond   is   Rs.1115.03/-,   which   is   at   a   premium   to   face  
value. 
2. The   coupon   is   paid   as   a   percentage   of   the   face   value.   The   coupon   for  
this   bond   is   8.01%,   which   means   that   every   bond   you   hold   gives   you  
Rs.80.01/-   as   interest   income   until   it   matures.   
3. Upon   maturity,   the   redemption   value   depends   on   the   bond's   face  
value.   More   on   this   later.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
186    

187    
The   next   section   highlights   the   interest   payment   details.   As   highlighted,   the  
REC   bond   pays   the   interest   on   1st   Dec   every   year,   till   the   bond   matures.   The  
company   pays   out   interest   annually.   Some   bonds   pay   interest   semiannually,  
quarterly,   and   some   even   pay   monthly.   
You   can   also   see   the   maturity   date,   which   is   24th   September   2023.   
Now   that   you   know   these   details,   I'd   suggest   you   re-look   at   the   COIN  
snapshot.   Everything   mentioned   in   the   snapshot   should   be   clear,   except   for  
the   YTM.   
  15.3   -   Yield   to   Maturity   
The   concept   of   'Yield   to   Maturity'   or   YTM   is   one   of   the   most   important  
concepts   to   understand   when   dealing   with   bonds.   While   the   bond's   coupon   is  
essential,   as   an   investor   in   bonds,   you   need   to   be   more   concerned   about   the 
YTM   than   the   coupon   itself.   
I   think   the   concept   of   YTM   is   best   understood   if   we   look   at   it   from   transactions  
we   are   familiar   with.   Given   this,   let   us   build   a   hypothetical   situation   around  
this.   
Scenario   1   
Your   friend   informs   you   about   a   fantastic   commercial   property,   capable   of  
giving   you   a   20%   rental   yield   on   the   investment.   
Rental   yield   =   Total   rent   collected   in   the   year   /   Amount   invested   in   the 
property.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
187    

188    
You   get   all   excited,   because,   from   your   research,   the   average   commercial  
rental   yield   is   about   15%,   so   the   deal   your   friend   proposed   stands   out.   You  
ask   your   friend   for   more   information.   
He   tells   that   the   fair   price   for   the   commercial   property   is   3   Crores.   You   do   not  
bat   an   eyelid;   you   pay   3   Crore   cash   down   and   buy   the   property.   
From   the   next   month,   you   start   receiving   a   rent   of   Rs.500,000/-   into   your  
account.   
Twelve   months   pass   by,   and   rental   income   is   flowing   smoothly.   
However,   at   the   end   of   12   months,   you   have   a   premonition   that   a   virus   will   hit  
the   world,   people   will   start   working   from   home,   and   therefore   the  
commercial   real   estate   will   lose   its   sheen.   
You   decide   to   sell   the   property   and   cash   out.   Assume   the   property   market  
stayed   flat;   hence,   you   get   to   sell   the   property   at   cost,   i.e.   3   Crore.   
The   question   is,   how   much   did   you   make   on   this   entire   transaction?   In   other  
words,   what   was   your   Net   Yield?   For   the   sake   of   simplicity,   forget   about   taxes  
and   charges.   
This   is   a   straightforward   calculation   -   
Buy   Price   =   3   Crore   
Sell   Price   =   3   Crore   
P&L   on   Property   =   0    ----   (1)   
Rental   per   month   =   Rs.500,000/-   
zerodha.com/varsity    
188    

189    
Number   of   months   rent   collected   =   12   
Total   Rental   income   =   12   *   500,000   =   Rs.60,00,000/-    -----   (2)   
Net   P&L   =    (1)   +   (2)   
=   Rs.60,00,000/-   
Net   Yield   =   Net   P&L   /   Buy   price   
=   60   Lakh   /   3   Crore   
=   20%   
The   net   yield   equals   the   rental   yield.   
Scenario   2   
Everything   remains   the   same,   except   that   at   the   time   of   buying,   instead   of   3  
Crore,   you   bought   the   property   at   3.3   Crore.   What   is   the   net   yield?   
Buy   Price   =   3.3   Crore   
Sell   Price   =   3   Crore   
P&L   on   Property   =   A   loss   of   30   Lakh    ----   (1)   
Rental   per   month   =   Rs.500,000/-   
Number   of   months   rent   collected   =   12   
Total   Rental   income   =   12   *   500,000   =   Rs.60,00,000/-    -----   (2)   
Net   P&L   =    (1)   +   (2)   
=   Rs.30,00,000/-   
zerodha.com/varsity    
189    

190    
Net   Yield   =   Net   P&L   /   Buy   price   
=   30   Lakh   /   3.3   Crore   
=   9.09%   
Notice,   everything   remained   the   same,   except   for   the   buy   price.   However,   this  
had   a   big   impact   on   the   net   yield.   
  Scenario   3   
Everything   remains   the   same,   except   that   at   the   time   of   buying,   instead   of   3  
Crore,   you   bought   the   property   at   2.9   Crore.   What   is   the   net   yield?   
Buy   Price   =   2.9   Crore   
Sell   Price   =   3   Crore   
P&L   on   Property   =   +10   Lakh    ----   (1)   
Rental   per   month   =   Rs.500,000/-   
Number   of   months   rent   collected   =   12   
Total   Rental   income   =   12   *   500,000   =   Rs.60,00,000/-    -----   (2)   
Net   P&L   =    (1)   +   (2)   
=   Rs.70,00,000/-   
Net   Yield   =   Net   P&L   /   Buy   price   
=   70   Lakh   /   3   Crore   
=   24.14%   

Notice,   in   all   the   three   scenarios,   the   rental   yield   was   fixed   at   20%   that   dint  
change   at   all.   But   the   net   yield   changed,   based   on   the   transaction   prices.   
In   summary   -   
● The   rental   yield   and   the   net   yield   matches   only   when   the   buy   and   sell  
remains   the   same   
● The   net   yield   is   lesser   than   the   rental   yield   when   the   buy   price   is   higher  
than   the   selling   price   
● The   net   yield   is   higher   than   the   rental   yield   when   the   buy   price   is   lower  
than   the   selling   price.   
The   point   that   I'm   trying   to   make   here   is   that   net   yield   is   very   diﬀerent   from  
the   rental   yield.   
Now,   let   us   snap   back   to   the   bonds   world   and   make   few   comparisons   -   
Buy   price   of   the   property   =   Buy   price   of   the   bond   
Sell   price   of   the   property   =   Sell   price   of   the   bond   
Rental   yield   =   Coupon   
Net   yield   =   Yield   to   maturity   or   YTM.   
Look   at   this   again   -   
 
The   coupon   is   8.01%,   but   the   YTM   is   5.4%.   Why   do   you   think   the   YTM   is   lesser  
than   the   coupon   itself?   
zerodha.com/varsity    
191    

192    
Well,   that   is   because   you   buy   this   bond   at   Rs.1115.03/-   and   upon   maturity,  
this   bond   is   redeemed   at   Rs.1000/-   (scenario   2).   
So   the   eﬀective   return   you   experience   here   is   5.4%.   
15.4   -   Accrued   Interest   
Clicking   on   the   yellow   invest   button   takes   you   to   the   next   screen   on   the  
platform,   which   gives   you   a   bit   more   information   on   the   bond.   
 
I   suppose   you   are   familiar   with   most   of   the   information   present   on   this  
screen,   except   for   the   accrued   interest   bit.   The   concept   of   accrued   interest   is  
straightforward   to   understand.   
We   know   the   REC   bond   pays   a   coupon   of   8.01%   on   Rs.1000/-   face   value.   The  
Rupee   value   of   the   coupon   is   Rs.80.01/-.   
The   coupon   of   Rs.80.01/-   gets   paid   once   a   year   or   once   in   365   days.   We   know  
the   date   of   payment   is   the   1st   December   every   year.   
The   last   coupon   was   paid   on   1st   December   2019,   and   the   next   coupon   will   be  
paid   on   1st   December   2020.   Between   the   previous   coupon   paid   and   the   next  
coupon   date,   interest   accrues   daily.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
192    

193    
If   you   do   the   math   -   
Daily   accrued   interest   =   Yearly   coupon   amount   /   365   
=   80.01/365   
=   0.219452   Paisa.   
Therefore,   by   holding   this   bond,   the   bondholder   earns   0.219452   daily.   
Today   is   21st   May   2020;   it   is   172   days   since   the   last   coupon   paid.   Therefore,   by  
holding   this   bond   for   172   days,   the   owner   of   this   bond   is   entitled   to   receive   -   
0.219452   *   172   
=    Rs.37.745/-   
From   the   screenshot   above,   you   can   see   that   the   accrued   interest   is  
Rs.37.86/-,   which   is   approximate   to   what   we   have   calculated.   
The   settlement   price   seen   is   Rs.1115.47/-,   which   also   includes   the   accrued  
interest.   Therefore,   you   can   break   the   settlement   price   into   two   components  
-   
Settlement   Price   =   Price   of   the   Bond   +   Accrued   Interest   
=   1077.609   +   37.8615   
= 1115.47/-   
So   why   does   the   settlement   price   include   the   accrued   interest?   
Well,   this   is   because   when   you   buy   the   bond,   you   need   to   compensate   the  
bond   seller   the   interest   he   has   earned   for   the   duration   he   has   held   the   bond.  
zerodha.com/varsity    
193    

194    
Hence,   the   settlement   price   includes   accrued   interest.   Also   note   that   when  
the   next   coupon   is   paid   by   REC,   you   as   the   current   bondholder   will   receive  
the   full   coupon   amount   of   Rs.80.01/-   (thus   compensating   for   the   accrued  
interest   that   you   paid   to   the   seller).   
While   we   are   at   it,   a   bit   of   bond   terminology   for   you.   
The   settlement   price   is   also   called   the   ' Dirty   Price '   of   the   bond   and   the  
settlement   price   minus   the   accrued   interest   is   called   the   ' Clean   price '   of   the  
bond   

If   you've   read   Varsity   by   now,   you'd   probably   know   me   as   a   one   hundred  
percentage   equities   guy.   I've   mentioned   this   in   several   places   with   due  
caution   that   100%   equity   is   not   perhaps   the   right   approach   to   build   a   long  
term   portfolio.   I   always   knew   that   I   have   to   fix   this   and   start   to   diversify   my  
little   savings.   It's   just   that   I   pushed   my   asset   allocation   plans   further   and  

A   40%   decline   in   the   Index   in   less   than   a   month.   All   gains   wiped   clean.   For   the  
first   time   since   I   started   investing   in   the   markets,   I   saw   that   the   ten   year   SIPs  
go   negative   as   well.   I   do   not   think   this   had   happened   in   the   2008   market   crash  
either.   Look   at   this   chart;   I've   got   this   from   Value   Research   website   -   

Perhaps   this   is   a   strong   enough   reason   for   me   to   get   started   with   asset  

CHAPTER    16   
Index   Funds   
16.1   Overview   
In   chapter    6    &    7 ,   we   discussed   the   basics   of   a   mutual   fund   and   how   a   fund  
works.   Just   to   recap,   a   mutual   fund   is   a   pooled   investment   vehicle   that   takes  
your   money,   invests   and   manages   it   on   your   behalf.   What   distinguishes   one  
fund   from   another   is   the   management   part.   There   are   100s   of   strategies   that  
AMCs   employ   but   broadly   speaking,   you   can   categorize   them   as:   
● Active   
● Passive   
In   an   active   mutual   fund,   the   fund   manager   tries   to   beat   a   benchmark   or  
deliver    alpha .   In   simple   terms,   alpha   is   the   excess   return   above   a   benchmark.   
Before   we   go   further,   it's   important   to   understand   what   a   benchmark   is   and  
why   do   you   need   a   benchmark.   A   benchmark   serves   as   a   point   of   reference  
for   measuring   performance   because   you   cannot   look   at   the   performance   of   a  
mutual   fund   in   isolation.   Every   mutual   fund   benchmarks   itself   to   an   index   like  
the   Niy   100,   Niy   Midcap   150,   Niy   Smallcap   100,   etc   depending   on   the  
category   it   operates   in.   Benchmarks   also   give   you   an   idea   of   the   returns   you  
would've   made   if   you   had   done   nothing   and   just   bought   the   index.   
Now,   the   job   of   the   active   manager   is   to   deliver   returns   over   and   above   the  
benchmark.   He   does   this   by   actively   picking   stocks   or   based   on   various  
strategies   and   by   deviating   from   the   benchmark   to   various   degrees.   For  
zerodha.com/varsity

198    
example,   one   of   the   most   widely   used   strategies   among   mutual   funds   is   Value  
investing.   Here   a   manager   tries   to   pick   stocks   that   are   cheaper   than   their  
intrinsic   value.   On   the   other   end   of   the   spectrum,   there's   growth   investing  
where   a   manager   invests   in   companies,   as   the   name   implies   that   is   growing   at  
a   faster   rate   than   their   peers/industry   and   also   invest   most   of   the   earnings  
back   in   the   business   to   fuel   the   growth.   Similarly,   there   are   hundreds   and  
thousands   of   approaches   and   strategies   used   by   managers,   which   is   outside  
the   scope   of   this   chapter,   but   I   hope   you   got   the   idea.   The   job   of   an   active  
manager   is   to   beat   the   benchmark.   
A   passive   fund   or   an   index   fund,   on   the   other   hand,   simply   tracks   the  
performance   of   a   benchmark   as   closely   as   possible.   It   does   not   try   to  
outperform   or   underperform   the   benchmark,   but   just   match   the   returns  
before   costs   (expense   ratio).   Mutual   funds   have   costs,   so   the   return   of   an  
index   fund,   broadly   speaking,   will   be   the   benchmark   returns   minus   costs.   
So,   when   you   invest   in   a   Niy   50   index   fund,   all   you   are   getting   is   Niy   50  
returns.   If   Niy   50   returns   10%   this   year,   your   return   will   be   10%   minus   the  
expense   ratio.   It's   as   simple   as   that.   

16.2   History   
Before   we   look   at   the   performance   of   active   funds,   why   index   funds   make  
sense   etc,   I   think   it's   important   to   know   a   little   history   about   how   index   funds  
came   to   be.   
The   story   of   how   the   first   index   fund   came   to   be   is   quite   fascinating.   John   C.  
Bogle,   also   known   as   Jack   Bogle,   the   founder   Vanguard,   launched   the   first  
index   fund   in   1976.   The   fund   was   called   the   First   Index   Investment   and  
tracked   the   S&P   500   Index.   The   fund   was   later   renamed   as   the   Vanguard   500  
Index   Fund.   For   context,   the   S&P   500   consists   of   the   500   biggest   US  
companies,   and   the   index   is   a   market   capitalization-weighted.   Meaning,   the  
total   free   float   outstanding   shares   of   a   company   are   multiplied   by   its   price  
zerodha.com/varsity    
199    

200    
and   higher   the   value,   higher   the   weight   of   that   stock   in   the   index,   and   it's   that  
simple.   Niy   and   Sensex   follow   the   same   methodology   as   well   minus   a   few  
technicalities.   
The   crazy   thing   about   the   first   index   fund   is   that   the   launch   was   an   abject  
failure.   Vanguard   led   by   Jack   Bogle   was   hoping   to   raise   $150   million   during  
the   underwriting   process   but   managed   to   raise   just   $11.3   million.   They   didn't  
even   have   enough   money   to   buy   all   the   shares   in   the   index.   What   they   ended  
up   doing   is   they   sampled   the   index,   they   just   bought   enough   stocks   across  
sectors   to   broadly   resemble   an   index,   and   it   worked   out   well   in   the   end.   If  
Jack   Bogle   had   given   up,   we   probably   would   have   had   to   wait   longer   for   an  
index   fund   and   history   would   have   been   much   diﬀerent.   
Even   though   it   was   launched   in   1976,   the   Vanguard   500   Index   Fund   didn't  
reach   the   $1   billion   mark   until   1990.   As   of   writing   this   chapter,   however,   the  
fund   has   $500   billion   in   assets   and   is   the   largest   mutual   fund   on   the   planet.  
This   fund   alone   is   bigger   than   the   entire   Indian   mutual   fund   industry,   which  
has   about   $350   billion   in   assets.   As   for   Vanguard,   it   is   the   second-largest   AMC  
in   the   world   with   over   $6   trillion   in   assets,   next   only   to   Blackrock,   which   has  
close   to   $7   trillion   in   assets.   
India   
IDBI   Principal   was   the   first   AMC   to   launch   an   index   mutual   fund   tracking   Niy  
in   India.   The   scheme   later   became   the   Principal   Niy   100   Equal-Weight   fund.  
Benchmark   AMC   was   the   first   to   launch   Niybees   -   an   index   exchange-traded  
fund   (ETF)   tracking   the   Niy   50.   Benchmark   was   later   acquired   by   Goldman  
Sachs   India   which   was   acquired   by   Reliance   mutual   fund   which   was   acquired  
by   Nippon.   

Today,   the   biggest   mutual   fund   in   India   is   an   Index   fund   -   the   SBI   Niy   50   ETF  
with   over   Rs   60,000   crores   in   AUM.   Before   you   start   thinking   when   did   index  
funds   become   so   popular   in   India,   they   aren't   
🙂
   Pretty   much   all   of   the 
money   in   this   ETF   is   from   The   Employees'   Provident   Fund   Organisation  
(EPFO).   It   started   investing   in   equities   since   2015   and   Niy,   and   Sensex   ETFs  
were   the   chosen   routes.   The   AUM   if   Index   mutual   funds   is   a   better   proxy   of  
the   popularity   of   these   funds   and   as   of   April   2020,   they   just   had   Rs   8,800  
crores   in   AUM.   
 
This   is   nothing   compared   to   the   Rs   119,861   crores   in   active   large-cap   mutual  
funds,   for   example.   
16.3   Definition   of   an   index   fund   
The   active   vs   passive   debate   is   one   of   the   longest-running,   loudest,   and   one 
the   most   controversial   debates   in   finance,   I'll   get   to   that   later.   But   even   when  
it   comes   to   the   definition   of   an   index   fund,   there   are   widely   diﬀerent  
thoughts.   Today,   any   fund   that   tracks   an   index   is   called   an   index   fund.   You  
can   technically   create   an   index   of   companies   whose   name   starts   with   the  
letter    G    and   then   launch   a   fund   tracking   that   index.   But   the   very   first   index  
fund   was   tracked   the   S&P   500   which   is   a   market   capitalization-weighted  
index.   But   according   to   the   hardcore   finance   guys   and   academics,   a   true  
index   fund   is   one   that   tracks   a   broad   cap-weighted   index   like   the   Niy   50,  
S&P   500   etc.   

16.4   Do   index   funds   work? 
You   may   be   wondering   given   that   index   funds   just   track   a   benchmark   and   not  
seek   to   outperform,   how   do   they   even   make   sense,   it's   a   fair   question.  
Outperformance   is   always   better   than   just   benchmark   returns,   right?   Let's  
unwrap   this.   There   are   a   bunch   of   complicated   ways   this   can   be   answered,  
but   here's   the   gist.   If   you   think   about   it,   markets   are   a   zero-sum   game,  
meaning   for   every   person   making   money,   somebody   has   to   lose   money.  
Here's   an   illustration   to   explain   that:    
 
This   means   that   all   active   managers   collectively   cannot   beat   the   market.   The  
reason   is   cost,   and   they   are   the   biggest   drag   on   the   performance.   
Now   forget   that   you   read   the   previous   paragraph   for   a   minute   and   let's   look  
at   costs.   An   active   mutual   fund   seeks   to   outperform   any   index,   which   means  
it   needs   the   resources   to   do   so.   This   involves   hiring   a   bunch   of   analysts,  
getting   the   best   Chief   Investment   Oﬀicer(s),   the   best   research,   the   best   tools   -  

your   Bloomberg   Terminals   what   have   you   and   other   things.   All   this   doesn't  
come   cheap,   and   there   are   costs   involved.   
How   much?   Let's   compare   the   expense   ratios   of   active   large-cap   mutual  
funds   and   index   mutual   funds.   Moneycontrol   shows   the   category   average  
expense   ratios,   which   allows   you   to   quickly   get   a   sense.   The   category   average  
expense   ratio   of   active   mutual   large-cap   mutual   funds   (direct   plans)   is   1.28%   
 
The   category   average   for   index   funds,   on   the   other   hand,   is   0.31%.   
 
Note:   the   average   expense   ratios   will   be   far   higher   for   regular   plans   of   mutual  
funds.   
That's   almost   a   1%   diﬀerence.   Though   this   might   seem   small,   costs  
compound   over   a   long   period   and   significantly   eat   into   your   returns.   If   you  
are   investing   on   Coin,   you'd   have   already   realized   this   and   made   the   smart  
choice.   But   just   to   reiterate,   you   can   use   the   savings   calculator   on   Coin   to  
calculate   the   impact   of   costs.   Here's   the   diﬀerence   between   paying   .6%   and  
1.6%   on   a   Rs   10,000   SIP   over   20   years.   That   tiny   1%   diﬀerence   will   cost   you   Rs  
12.8   lakhs.   

 
Assuming   that   an   active   mutual   fund   is   charging   1.5%   is   benchmarked   to  
Niy   50   for   example   and   let's   assume   that   the   Niy   Index   fund   charges   0.10%.  
Right   out   of   the   gate,   the   active   fund   is   at   a   disadvantage   and   has   to   generate  
1.4%   just   to   keep   up   with   the   benchmark,   and   I   am   not   even   talking   about  
outperforming   the   benchmark.   
Index   funds,   on   the   other   hand,   are   extremely   cheap.   The   SBI   Niy   ETF  
charges   0.07%   for   comparison.   The   reason   why   index   funds   and   ETFs   are  
cheap   is   that   they   don't   need   highly   paid   star   fund   managers,   research   teams  
etc.   All   they   have   to   do   is   copy   an   index,   and   that's   it.   
  16.5   Historical   Performance   
Let's   look   at   the   historical   performance   of   active   funds   and   index   funds.   I  
know   at   this   point,   you   are   thinking   about   those   huge   past   returns   displayed  
prominently   on   AMC   sites,   Value   research   and   elsewhere.   S&P   -   the   world's  
zerodha.com/varsity    
204    

205    
largest   index   provider   publishes   a   semi-annual   report   called   the   S&P   Indices  
Versus   Active   ( SPIVA(r) )   scorecard.   This   report   looks   at   the   performance   of  
active   funds   versus   a   standardized   benchmark   period   for   1,3,5,10   periods.  
Here's   how   the   Indian   active   mutual   funds   have   fared   as   of   the    end   of   2019 .    
On   5   years,   82%   of   active   large-cap   funds   have   underperformed   the   S&P   BSE  
100   index,   which   consists   of   the   100   largest   Indian   companies   by   market   cap.   
Although   the   performance   of   mid   and   small-caps   looks   promising,   things  
seem   to   be   changing.   With   the   recategorization   exercise,   SEBI   has   clearly  
defined   the   universe   of   stocks   fund   managers   can   invest   in   which   will   make  
outperformance   harder.   Up   until   last   year,   we   didn't   have   mid-cap   index  
mutual   funds,   we   had   ETFs,   but   they   were   illiquid.   Several   AMCs   have   started  
launching   them   over   the   past   year   or   so.   
As   for   small-caps,   active   or   passive,   I   don't   think   investors   should   invest   in  
these   funds   at   all.   They   seem   to   fall   as   fast   as   they   go   up,   which   makes   it  
frustrating   for   investors   to   hold   on   to.   That   gut-wrenching   volatility   also  
increasing   the   chances   of   investors   buying   high   and   selling   low.   
16.6   Bottomline   
Based   on   the   numbers   at   any   given   point,   your   chances   of   picking   a  
consistently   performing   active   fund   is   worse   than   50:50.   In   the   case   of  
large-caps,   it's   consistently   worse.   And   it's   going   to   get   worse   as   the   Indian  
capital   markets   deepen.   Let's   take   the   case   of   large-caps,   and   there   are   40  
AMCs   and   40   large-cap   funds.   Broadly   speaking   everybody   pretty   much   has  
access   to   the   same   information   and   everybody   can   only   invest   in   the   top   100  
zerodha.com/varsity

stocks,   outperforming   the   benchmark   isn't   easy,   not   to   mention   the   cost  
disadvantage   they   have   vs   index   funds.   
And   there's   also   the   issue   of   funds   just   hugging   benchmarks   which   is   quite 
common   -   this   is   also   referred   to   as   closet   indexing.   Most   funds   don't   deviate  
significantly   from   the   benchmarks,   and   aer   expenses,   they   are   guaranteed  
to   underperform   the   index.   
There's   another   way   of   looking   at   this.   Famed   researcher   Michael  
Mauboussin,    in   this   paper ,   termed   this   the   paradox   of   skill:   
"In   cases   where   two   or   more   players   have   the   same   level   of   skill-whether   that  
skill   is   high   or   low   doesn't   matter-the   skills   of   the   players   oﬀset   one   another  
and   luck   becomes   the   primary   determinant   of   the   outcome.   "Players"   can   be  
athletes,   investors,   or   business   executives.   In   many   competitive   realms,  
including   investing,   the   skills   of   the   participants   have   improved   on   an   absolute  
basis   but   have   shrunk   on   a   relative   basis.   Today's   investor   has   vastly   more  
resources   and   training   than   his   or   her   predecessor   from   years   past.   The  
problem   is   that   investors,   broadly   speaking,   have   gotten   much   better   which  
means   that   the   diﬀerence   between   the   skill   of   the   best   and   the   average  
participant   isn't   as   great   as   it   used   to   be"   
16.7   Fixed   income   (Debt)   
So   far,   when   I   say   an   index   fund,   I've   meant   equity   index   funds.   Globally   in   the  
last   5-10   years   index   funds   including   debt   index   funds,   have   experienced 
phenomenal   growth.   Bond   ETFs   recently   crossed   the   $1   trillion   mark   in   the  
US.   In   case   you   are   wondering   if   there   are   any   debt   index   funds   in   India,   these  
are   very   early   days   for   equity   index   funds,   let   alone   debt   index   funds.   Except  

for   the   recently   launched   Bharat   Bond   ETF   and   fund   of   fund,   we   don't   have  
any   debt   index   funds.   
The   Indian   debt   markets   are   very   tiny   and   notoriously   illiquid.   Except   for  
G-Secs   and   the   best   AAA-rated   bonds,   most   other   bonds   trade   sparingly.   And  
unlike   equities   which   trade   on   the   exchanges   and   there's   transparent   price  
discovery,   most   of   the   trading   activity   in   bonds   happens   over   the   counter  
(OTC)   or   oﬀ-market.   It's   the   same   even   in   the   US,   where   the   debt   market   is  
bigger   than   the   equity   market.   
This,   among   many   other   things,   makes   indexing   debt   very   hard,   but   maybe   as  
the   markets   evolve,   things   should   change.   There   are   companies   like  
Tradeweb    trying   to   bring   electronic   trading   to   the   bond   markets.   
16.8   Active   or   passive   (Conclusion)   
Aer   reading   all   this,   you   might   be   wondering   if   you   should   choose   active   or  
index   funds.   It's   not   active   or   passive   but   active   and   passive.   You   can   mix   both  
in   your   portfolio   and   have   allocation   based   on   your   risk   tolerance.   But   always  
pick   a   fund   that   has   a   long   track   record   and   sticks   it's   stated   mandate.   Before  
the   SEBI   scheme   recategorization   exercise,   funds   didn't   have   any   restrictions  
on   how   they   could   invest.   Some   funds   used   to   be   labelled   large-cap   and   used  
to   invest   in   mid-cap   and   small-caps   to   juice   returns.   So,   picking   a   fund   where  
the   manager   does   what   he   says   is   important.   Funds   with   cowboy   managers  
pretty   much   always   end   up   as   disasters.   

I   have   also   mentioned   exchange-traded   funds   (ETFs)   in   the   chapter,   although  
they   are   similar   to   index   funds,   there   are   some   important   diﬀerences.   In   the  
next   chapter,   we'll   discuss   ETFs.   Similar   to   index   funds,   there's   a   category   of  
funds   called   smart-beta   funds,   which   have   grown   increasingly   popular   over  
the   past   decade.   The   term   "smart   beta"   is   meaningless,   at   the   core   these   are  
rules-based   funds,   and   we'll   also   briefly   understand   the   basics.   

CHAPTER    17   
Arbitrage   Funds   
  
17.1   -   Arbitrage   
We   were   to   move   ahead   and   discuss   MF   attributes   and   gradually   steer   our  
way   to   identify   techniques   of   building   a   mutual   fund   portfolio.   While   I   was   all  
set   to   do   that,   I   just   remembered   we   hadn't   discussed   the   'Arbitrage   Funds',  
which   for   some   reason   has   all   the   market   attention   these   days.   So   I'll   keep  
this   chapter   short,   consider   the   Arbitrage   fund   and   move   ahead.   
Before   we   understand   the   'Arbitrage   Fund',   we   need   to   understand   what  
'Arbitrage'   means.   Of   course,   if   you   are   a   regular   Varsity   reader,   then   this   is  
something   you   guys   are   familiar.   We   have   discussed   arbitrage   on   a   couple   of  
occasions,   in   particular,   we   have   looked   at   arbitrage   in   the   form   of   calendar  
spreads,   pair   trading,   and   put-call   parity.   
For   others   who   are   not   familiar   with   'Arbitrage',   here   is   a   quick   note.   
All   of   us,   at   some   point   in   life,   would   have   carried   out   an   arbitrage  
transaction.   For   example,   when   I   was   in   my   1st-year   college,   I'd   pay   my   cousin  
in   Singapore   to   buy   me   Rock   n   Roll   audio   cassettes   from   Rs.100/-   per   tape  
and   sell   the   same   here   in   Bangalore   for   Rs.150/-.   People   here   would   happily  
buy   the   tape   at   Rs.150/-   because   there   was   no   other   source   for   them   to   buy  
these   tapes.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
209    

210    
The   above   is   an   arbitrage   transaction.   
 
In   an   arbitrage   transaction,   you   buy   an   asset   (like   the   audiotape)   from   one  
market   (Singapore)   where   the   asset   is   selling   cheap   (Rs.100/-)   and   sell   the  
same   asset   (the   audiotape)   in   another   market   (Bangalore)   for   a   higher   price  
(150).   The   arbitrageur   (i.e.   me   in   this   example),   makes   a   risk   free   profit  
(Rs.50/-   in   this   case). 
If   you   think   about   this,   arbitrage   is   beautiful,   right?   If   the   above   were   to   hold,  
all   I   had   to   do   in   life   was   buy   tapes   from   Singapore   and   sell   the   same   in  
Bangalore.   I   do   this   in   large   quantities,   and   I'd   be   sitting   on   a   massive   pile   of  
cash.   
But   if   only   life   was   that   easy   
🙂
   
The   assumption   here   is   that   there   are   continuous   supply   and   demand   in   both  
markets.   I   mean   imagine   a   situation   where   I   buy   tapes   worth   Rs.100,000/-  
with   a   hope   to   sell   it   for   Rs.150,000/-   and   suddenly   I   realise   that   people   in  
zerodha.com/varsity    
210    

211    
Bangalore   are   no   longer   interested   in   Rock   n   Roll,   but   instead   prefer   listening  
to   Boyzone!   Then   my   money   is   gone,   right?   
So   the   point   is,   unlike   the   popular   notion,   arbitrage   is   not   risk-free.   What   we  
discussed   is   an   example   of   the   supply-demand   risk   associated   with   the  
arbitrage   opportunity.   
But   it   is   not   just   that.   
Imagine   another   scenario,   where   a   friend   of   mine   figures   my   little   trick,   and  
he   does   the   same,   i.e.   buy   tapes   from   Singapore   at   Rs.100/-   but   sells   the   same  
at   a   slightly   lower   rate   at   say   Rs.140/-   to   ensure   he   beats   me   at   my   own   game.   
What   do   you   think   would   happen   next?   A   price   war   would   break,   I'd   oﬀer   the  
same   at   say   135,   he   would   then   reduce   to   125   so   on   as   so   forth   till   all   the  
margins   evaporate.   
Point   being,   arbitrage   opportunity   or   arbitrage   profits   shrink   when   more  
people   try   to   exploit   the   same   opportunity.   
Now,   think   about   the   stock   markets.   Take   a   look   at   the   snapshot   below   -   
 
What   you   see   here   is   the   quote   for   Kirloskar   Industries,   on   NSE   it   is   trading   at  
562.4   per   share,   and   on   BSE   the   same   company   is   trading   at   546.40   per   share.  
There   is   a   diﬀerence   of   16   Rupees.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
211    

212    
The   above   is   an   arbitrage   opportunity.   All   you   have   to   do   is   buy   Kirloskar  
Industries   at   546.4   in   BSE   and   sell   the   same   stock   in   NSE   at   562.4.   Aer   all,   it's  
the   same   asset   but   two   diﬀerent   prices   in   two   diﬀerent   markets. 
If   one   were   to   execute   this   transaction   well,   then   a   16   Rupee   profit   is   more   or  
less   guaranteed.   
A   mutual   fund   scheme   that   manages   money   by   mostly   chasing   such   arbitrage  
opportunities   in   the   market   is   called   'The   Arbitrage   Fund'.   
  17.2   -   The    Arbitrage   Fund   
While   we   looked   at   one   type   of   arbitrage   opportunity   in   the   previous   section,  
in   reality,   there   are   many   types   of   arbitrage   opportunities   in   the   market.   
For   instance,   one   of   the   most   attractive   arbitrage   opportunity   that   the   mutual  
fund   looks   for   is   the   'Spot-Future'   arbitrage,   wherein   the   futures   trade   at   a  
price   which   is   significantly   away   from   its   fair   value   when   compared   to   its  
underlying   price.   
In   other   words,   at   any   given   point,   the   fund   is   continuously   long   or   short   on  
the   stock   in   either   the   equity   or   futures   market.   
Did   the   above   line   confuse   you?   Let   me   elaborate   this   a   bit   just   to   give   you  
clarity   on   what   happens   under   the   hood   of   an   Arbitrage   Fund.   Take   a   look   at  
the   snapshot   below   -   
 
zerodha.com/varsity

213    
As   of   today,   i.e.   18th   June   2020,   the   stock   price   of   Maruti   is   at   Rs.5,714.4/-   per  
share.   However,   Maruti's   future's   is   trading   at   Rs.5,735.6/-.   
The   diﬀerence   between   cash   and   futures   is   - 
5,735.6   -   5,714.4   
=    21.2   
The   diﬀerence   between   cash   and   futures   is   called   the   spread   or   the   basis.   One  
can   capture   the   spread   by   setting   up   an   arbitrage.   Remember   the   thumb   rule  
in   arbitrage   is   to   buy   the   asset   in   the   cheaper   market   and   sell   the   same   asset  
in   the   expensive   market.   Hence,   all   one   has   to   do   here   is   -   
Buy   Maruti   @   5714.4   in   the   cash   market   
Sell   Maruti   Futures   (Exping   in   June)@   5735.6   
It   is   important   to   ensure   the   above   transaction   is   simultaneously   executed.  
Once   you   do,   you've   locked   in   the   spread,   and   it   no   longer   matters   where  
Maruti   trades   because   the   spread   of   21.6   is   guaranteed.   
The   key   here   is   the   fact   that   on   the   expiry   day,   Maruti   in   cash   and   Futures   will  
trade   at   a   single   price   (unlike   today).   The   phenomenon   is   called  
'Cash-Futures   Convergence'.   So   this   trade   has   to   be   unwound   or   squared   oﬀ  
or   closed   on   the   expiry   day.   
For   example,   assume   on   the   expiry   day,   Maruti   trades   at   5780   in   both   the   cash  
and   futures   market.   The   P&L   is   as   follows   -   
Cash   market   trade   
Buy   @   5714.4   
zerodha.com/varsity    
213    

214    
Sell   @   5780.   
P&L   =5780   -   5714.4   
=   +   65.6   
Here   you   make   a   profit   of   65.6.   
Futures   market   trade   -   
Sell   @   5735.6   
Buy   @   5780   
P&L   =5735.6-   5780   
=   -44.4   
Here   you   make   a   loss   of   44.4.   
So,   on   the   one   hand,   you   make   a   profit   of   65.6,   and   on   the   other,   you   lose  
44.4,   but   overall   you   make   21.2,   i.e.   65.6   -   44.4.   
The   point   here   is   that   the   spread   is   locked   and   you   make   that   no   matter   what  
happens.   I'd   encourage   you   to   do   the   same   math   at   few   other   price   points  
and   see   what   happens.   
Of   course,   there   are   other   technicalities   like   rollover,   transaction   costs,  
execution   risk,   etc.   But   there   is   no   point   getting   into   these   details.   All   you  
need   to   do   if   understand   what   arbitrage   is   and   what   happens   in   an   arbitrage  
fund.   
Have   a   look   at   the   following;   this   is   an   extract   of   the   investment   objective   of  
DSP's   Arbitrage   fund   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
214    

215    
 
As   you   can   see,   the   fund   simply   states   that   they   aim   to   generate   income  
through   the   cash   and   derivatives   market,   without   getting   into   specific  
strategy   details.   Some   of   the   funds   also   use   the   term   'low   volatility   returns'   in  
their   scheme   description.   
 
A   pure   arbitrage   trade   such   as   the   spot-futures   arbitrage   is   inherently   less  
risky   with   a   predictable   outcome;   hence   it   is   naturally   low   volatile.   
However,   one   should   not   take   this   at   face   value.   Yes,   if   the   fund   is   100%  
focused   on   arbitrage   opportunities,   the   low   volatility   bit   would   have   been  
valid.   But   then,   look   at   SEBI's   definition   of   the   Arbitrage   Fund   -   
 
An   Arbitrage   fund   has   a   minimum   of   65%   of   the   funds   in   Arbitrage   strategies,  
which   implies   that   they   are   free   to   do   whatever   they   want   with   the   balance   of  
zerodha.com/varsity    
215    

216    
35%   of   the   funds.   There   is   no   restriction   on   that.   The   usual   practice   for  
Arbitrage   funds   is   to   invest   the   balance   35%   in   debt   funds,   and   since   there   is   a  
restriction   on   duration,   funds   usually   chase   yields.   Given   this,   an   arbitrage  
fund   is   not   a   'low   volatile'   
🙂
   
Have   a   look   at   the   portfolio   of   ICICI   Pru's   Arbitrage   fund   -   
 
Every   single   equity   position   is   hedged   with   its   futures;   these   are   mostly  
arbitrage   positions.   As   we   can   see,   nearly   65%   of   the   exposure   is   the   arbitrage  
position.   The   balance   35%   is   parked   in   debt   and   cash   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
216    

217    
 
The   presence   of   debt   papers   is   what   makes   the   arbitrage   funds   risky.   How  
risky   may   you   ask?   Well,   look   at   this   -   
 
If   I'm   not   wrong,   Principal   Arbitrage   Fund   held   a   concentrated   debt   position  
in   DHLF   bonds,   which   DHFL   defaulted   upon   sometime   in   October   2018.  
Naturally,   the   fund   took   a   hit,   and   the   NAV   nose-dived   from   11.5   to   about  
10.9,   translating   to   a   run   of   5.22%.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
217    

218    
In   all   fairness,   5.22%   is   not   a   big   hit,   but   the   problem   is   the   time   spent   on  
recovery.   It   took   nearly   1.5   years   to   recover   5.22%   and   push   the   NAV   back   to 
11.5.   
This   chart   teaches   us   three   lessons   about   the   Arbitrage   fund   -   
● As   many   investors   believe,   Arbitrage   funds   are   not   risk-free.   Thanks   to  
the   debt   component,   there   is   an   element   of   risk.   
● Returns   hover   in   the   range   of   about   5-7%,   which   can   get   wiped   out   in   a  
single   shot   if   things   go   wrong. 
● Recovery   takes   time.   Hence   it   is   prudent   to   have   a   long   term  
investment   horizon   while   investing   in   an   arbitrage   fund.   
I   hope   I've   not   scared   you   away   from   investing   in   an   Arbitrage   fund   
🙂
   
The   good   part   of   an   arbitrage   fund   is   that   it   behaves   as   a   debt   fund   but   gets  
taxed   as   an   equity   fund.   We   will   have   a   chapter   dedicated   to   mutual   fund  
taxation,   till   then,   here   is   how   taxation   works   (very   broadly)   -   
● Gains   from   Equity   funds   sold   within   12   months   are   treated   as   short  
term   capital   gain,   attracts   a   15%   tax.   
● Gains   from   Equity   funds   sold   aer   12   months   are   treated   as   long   term  
capital   gain,   attracts   a   10%   tax,   aer   an   exemption   of   Rs.1,00,000/-   
● Gain   from   debt   funds   held   for   less   than   36   months   is   treated   as   short  
term   capital   gains,   attracts   a   tax   as   per   the   investor's   income   tax   slab.   
● Gain   from   debt   funds   held   for   more   than   36   months   is   treated   as   long  
term   capital   gains,   attracts   a   20%   tax   post   indexation.   

219    
Given   the   tax   treatment,   in   my   opinion,   if   you   are   prepared   to   take   some   risk,  
then   use   the   Arbitrage   fund   as   a   proxy   for   say   low   duration   or   a   short   duration  
fund.   The   risk   and   return   profile   are   similar   for   these   funds.   
Hence,   in   my   opinion,   the   real   arbitrage   in   an   arbitrage   fund   is   the   tax  
arbitrage,   i.e.   it   behaves   like   a   debt   fund   and   gets   taxed   as   an   equity   fund.   
Lastly,   when   you   look   for   an   arbitrage   fund,   it   is   essential   to   look   at   the   debt  
component   of   the   portfolio.   Ensure   the   fund   does   not   have   concentrated   debt  
positions   and   also   ensure   the   there   are   no   papers   which   are   below   investible  
grade.   
Also,   it   is   crucial   to   confirm   that   the   arbitrage   fund   is   not   holding   any  
unhedged   equity   position   because   this   defeats   the   purpose   of   an   arbitrage  
fund.   
Next   up   is   Mutual   fund   metrics.   Stay   tuned.   
Key   takeaways   from   this   chapter   
1. Arbitrage   funds   are   hedged   position   
2. SEBI   mandates   AMCs   to   invest   a   minimum   of   65%   in   arbitrage  
strategies   
3. Mutual   funds   usually   spend   up   to   35%   in   debt   
4. Arbitrage   funds   can   be   volatile   
5. One   can   consider   Arbitrage   funds   as   a   proxy   for   low/short  
duration   funds   

CHAPTER    18   
Measuring   Mutual   Fund   Returns    
  
18.1   -   Mutual   Fund   metrics   
By   now,   I   suppose   we   understand   diﬀerent   types   of   mutual   fund   categories  
and   what   goes   under   the   hood   of   each   of   these   funds.   While   we   have   not  
covered   the   entire   gamut   of   funds,   I   think   we   have   covered   the   most  
important   funds   across   both   equity   and   debt.   
Probably   I   must   have   discussed   the   Balanced   fund   as   well,   not   sure   why   (and  
how)   I   missed   that.   But   I   also   believe   we   have   laid   down   a   foundation   for  
structured   thinking   about   funds   and   their   mandates.   So   I'd   request   you   to  
please   look   upon   few   balanced   fund   factsheets,   read   it   along   with   the   SEBI's  
classification   and   you   will   understand   how   the   balanced   fund   works.  
Otherwise,   you   can   always   drop   your   queries   here,   and   I'll   be   more   than 
happy   to   answer   them   for   you.   
Anyway,   I   think   we   are   now   one   step   closer   to   understand   how   one   can   build  
a   mutual   fund   portfolio   for   diﬀerent   financial   goals.   Before   we   get   into   the  
building   MF   portfolios,   we   must   spend   time   to   understand   few   mutual   fund  
metrics   that   help   us   understand   mutual   funds   better   and   the   ways   to  
diﬀerentiate   good   funds   from   the   not   so   good   funds.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
220    

221    
The   metrics   that   I'm   talking   about   are   all   mentioned   in   the   Mutual   fund  
factsheet,   and   few   others   are   mentioned   in   the   3rd   party   website   such   as 
Morningstar   and   Value   research.   We   need   to   pick   and   choose   the   right   set   of  
metrics   to   learn   and   ignore   the   pointless   ones.   
Over   the   next   few   chapters,   we   will   understand   the   following   metrics   that   are  
usually   published   by   the   AMCs   for   the   diﬀerent   schemes   that   they   run   -   
1. Returns   -   Absolute,   CAGR,   XIRR   
2. Rolling   Returns   
3. Expense   Ratio   
4. Benchmarking   
5. Exit   load 
6. Portfolio   turnover   ratio   
7. Standard   Deviation   
8. Beta   
9. Sharpe   Ratio   
10.Capture   ratios   
Of   course,   along   the   way,   if   I   feel   I've   missed   an   important   metrics,   then   I'll  
just   add   that   to   the   list   and   discuss   the   same.   
So   as   you   can   see,   we   have   a   lot   to   cover,   so   let's   get   started.   
18.2   -   Measuring   MF   investment   performance   
Mutual   fund   investors   oen   get   confused   with   the   way   returns   are   measured  
across   investments.   Most   investors   apply   the   standard   return   measurement  
technique   across   all   types   of   investment.   Doing   so   leads   to   wrong   return  
zerodha.com/varsity    
221    

222    
calculation   and   therefore,   wrong   analysis.   Return   measurement   is   one   of   the  
key   aspects   while   analyzing   a   mutual   fund.   We   should   start   our   discussion  
with   the   basic   concept   of   return   measurement.   
 
For   the   sake   of   this   discussion,   I'll   assume   that   you   are   familiar   with   the  
systematic   investment   plan   or   the   SIP.   I   guess   the   AMCs   and   the   regulators  
have   managed   to   do   a   phenomenal   job   at   conveying   the   concept   of   SIP   to  
every   taxpayer   in   the   country   (well,   all   most   all).   
Hence,   I   will   not   spend   time   to   discuss   what   a   SIP   is   and   its   massive  
advantage   for   an   investor.   If   you   are   not   familiar   with   what   a   SIP   is,   I   will  
request   you   to   spend   a   little   time   on   the   internet;   there   are   tons   of   great  
articles   with   SIP   calculators   to   help   you   understand   what   a   SIP   is   and   how   to  
set   up   one.   

However,   for   the   sake   of   the   completeness   of   this   discussion,   let   me   highlight  
two   popular   investments   techniques   -   
Lumpsum   investments   -   In   a   lumpsum   investment,   an   investor   decides   to  
invest   a   random   amount   (based   on   cash   available)   at   one   time.   Example   -   I  
get   a   yearly   bonus   of   Rs.1,00,000/-,   of   which   I   decide   to   invest   Rs.75,000/-   in   a  
mutual   fund.   
Systematic   Investment   Plan   (SIP)   -   SIP   investments   requires   you   to   invest   a  
fixed   amount   of   money   on   a   fixed   monthly   date   in   a   designated   fund.   The  
investment   can   be   weekly,   fortnightly,   monthly,   quarterly,   or   even   once   in   6  
months.   For   example,   my   very   first   SIP   was   set   to   invest   Rs.2,500/-   on   5th   of  
every   month   in   Sundaram   Midcap   fund.   There   is   no   end   date   to   this   and   can  
go   on   for   as   long   as   possible.   
The   way   one   measures   the   return   for   these   two   investments   is   very   diﬀerent.  
Most   investors   take   the   starting   and   ending   value   of   their   investment   and  
figure   out   what   the   return   is.   While   this   is   one   way   to   measure   returns,   this   is  
not   the   only   way.   While   measuring   return,   you   need   to   factor   time   into  
consideration.   
For   example,   if   I   tell   you   that   I   made   an   80%   return   on   a   certain   investment,  
what   would   your   first   reaction   be?   I   guess   you'd   say   its   amazing.   
Now,   what   if   said   that   I   made   80%   over   15   years?   Does   it   look   attractive?   I  
don't   think   so,   right?   Time   adds   a   very   important   dimension   while   we  
measure   the   return.   Hence   it   is   always   important   to   consider   time.   
Given   the   two   types   of   investment,   let   us   separate   these   investments   into  
diﬀerent   time   buckets   -   

223    

224    
 
The   table   above   helps   us   understand   the   diﬀerent   types   of   investment   and  
the   respective   type   of   return   we   should   calculate.   For   example,   we   should  
calculate   the   absolute   return   for   a   lumpsum   investment   which   is   less   than  
one   year.   Likewise,   we   should   look   at   the   XIRR   return   for   a   SIP   which   is   older  
than   a   year.   
Although   for   you   as   a   mutual   fund   investor,   you   don't   really   have   to   learn   how  
to   calculate   the   absolute   return,   CAGR   or   XIRR   because   there   are   tons   of   free  
return   calculators   available   online.   However,   I   think   it   will   just   make   you   a  
prudent   investor   if   you   take   a   little   time   to   figure   out   how   this   can   be   done.   
Let's   start   with   the   absolute   return.   
Remember   Absolute   Return   matters   only   if   the   investment   is   less   than   a   year.  
It   could   be   a   lump   sum   or   a   SIP,   but   as   long   as   the   investment   is   less   than   a  
year,   use   absolute   return.   
The   calculation   is   straight   forward.   Here   is   an   example   -   
On   Jan   1st   2020,   I   invest   Rs.25,000   in   a   Mutual   Fund.   On   July   7th,   the   value   of  
this   fund   is   Rs.30,000/-.   What   is   the   return   generated?   
You   should   recognise   that   this   is   a   lump   sum   invested   and   is   under   a   year.   
The   absolute   return   can   be   calculated   as   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
224    

225    
[Ending   Value/Beginning   Value]   -   1   
=   30,000/25,000   -   1   
=   20%   
Let's   take   another   case.   An   investor   invests   Rs.5,000/-   every   month   in   a  
Mutual   Fund.   Aer   six   months,   the   value   of   the   investment   is   Rs.35,000/-.  
What   is   the   return   experience   here?   
We   know   that   this   is   a   case   of   SIP   investments.   
Monthly   investment   -   Rs.5,000/-   
Number   of   months   -   6   (less   than   one   year)   
Total   investment   value   =   5000   *   6   =   Rs.30,000/-   
Current   value   of   investment   =   Rs.35,000/-   
We   need   to   apply   the   absolute   value   calculation   here   -   
=35,000/30,000   -1   
=17%   
For   SIPs   less   than   one   year,   we   can   indeed   calculate   XIRR,   but   from   my  
experience,   the   most   investor   will   not   comprehend   this   number   well   as   it   is  
non-intuitive.   
Let   us   revisit   the   SIP   for   less   than   one   year   a   little   later   to   understand   why   this  
may   not   be   the   best   choice.   For   now,   all   you   need   to   know   if   that   if   an  
investment   (lumpsum   or   SIP)   is   less   than   a   year,   then   you   have   to   use  
absolute   returns.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
225    

226    
Next   up   is   the   CAGR.   
CAGR   or   the   Compounded   Annual   Growth   Rate   measures   the   'rate   at   which  
the   investment   is   growing'.   Let   us   take   a   quick   example   and   deep   dive   into  
this   - 
I   invest   Rs.25,000/-   on   1st   of   July   2017   in   a   certain   Mutual   Fund.   Three   years  
later,   the   investment   has   grown   to   Rs.40,000/-.    What   is   the   return   on   this  
investment?   
I've   kept   the   question   in   bold   to   draw   your   attention   to   the   question   itself.   We  
will   revisit   that   in   a   bit.   
You   should   identify   that   this   is   a   lumpsum   investment.   Since   the   period   is  
more   than   one   year,   we   need   to   use   the   CAGR   to   calculate   the   return.   The 
formula   to   calculate   the   CAGR   is   straight   forward   -   
[Ending   Value   /   Starting   Value   ]^(1/n)   -   1   
Where   n   is   time   in   years.   Let   us   apply   this   formula   -   
=   [40,000/25,000]^(1/3)-1   
=   16.96%   
The   investment   made   in   this   fund   has   grown   at   a   rate   of   16.96%   on   year   on  
year   basis.   Recognise   that   this   is    the   growth   rate   of   the   investment.   
The   most   common   confusion   for   the   investor   is   this   -   
I   invest   25,000,   which   has   grown   to   40,000,   which   means   a   profit   of   15,000.  
The   return   should   is   about   60%,   i.e.   15K   profit   on   25K   investment.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
226    

227    
Of   course,   there   is   nothing   wrong   with   this   calculation.   Aer   all,   this   is   the  
absolute   return   we   are   calculating   here.   
The   question,   however,   is   that   did   you   get   this   60%   in   the   first,   2nd,   or   3rd  
year?   Was   it   that   you   got   the   entire   return   in   the   1st   year   and   since   then   the  
investment   has   stayed   flat?   Or   was   the   return   generated   in   the   3rd   year   with  
the   first   two   years   netting   zero   return?   
Of   course,   one   can   get   into   the   depths   of   this   and   figure   the   details.   But  
otherwise,   we   simply   ignore   the   specifics   and   take   the   average   growth   on  
year   on   year   basis.   Higher   the   average   the   better   investment   this   is.   
To   put   this   in   perspective,   think   about   a   road   journey.   Let   us   say   you   are  
travelling   from   Delhi   to   Jaipur   by   car.   
If   I   ask   you   at   what   speed   you   drove   your   car,   will   you   tell   me   that   your   drove  
at   80   kmph   from   Delhi   to   Gurugram,   110   kmph   from   Gurugram   to   Panchgaon,  
about   90   kmph   between   Panchgaon   to   Neemrana   so   on   and   so   forth   or   will  
you   just   tell   me   that   you   drove   an   average   speed   of   100   kmph?   
You   won't   give   me   the   split;   you   will   give   me   average   speed.   
Likewise,   when   we   look   at   a   multi-year   investment   period,   the   years   in  
between   are   like   the   town   on   a   journey.   Based   on   the   market   conditions   (just  
like   the   traﬀic)   investment   generates   diﬀerent   returns   (like   driving   at   a  
diﬀerent   speed)   during   these   years.   Some   years   may   be   positive,   and   few   may  
be   negative.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
227    

228    
As   a   long   term   investor,   we   ignore   these   yearly   variations   in   returns   and   take  
an   average   return   of   the   investment,   which   is   what   CAGR   does.   It   is   the  
growth   rate   of   investment.   
Now,   go   back   to   the   initial   question,   which   was   intentionally   kept   in   bold.   Do  
you   think   that   is   the   right   question?   
No,   the   real   question   to   ask   should   have   been   -   '   I   invest   Rs.25,000/-   on   1st   of  
July   2017   in   a   certain   Mutual   Fund.   Three   years   later,   the   investment   has  
grown   to   Rs.40,000/-.   What   is   the   growth   rate   of   this   investment?   
I   hope   you   get   the   subtle   but   a   the   very   important   distinction   on   the   two  
diﬀerent   questions.   
Ok,   let's   go   back   to   the   Delhi   and   Jaipur   example.   I   know   that   the   average  
speed   is   100   kmph.   At   this   rate,   how   much   time   will   you   take   to   reach   Ajmer,  
which   is   another   150   km   away   from   Jaipur?   
Quite   easy   -   I   know   the   average   speed,   so   you   are   likely   to   take   about   1   hour  
30   mins   to   reach   Ajmer.   
On   a   similar   note,   I   know   the   investment   grew   at   16.96%.   What   is   the   likely  
value   of   my   investment   if   I   let   this   investment   run   for   another   say   one   year?   
Quite   easy   -   
Current   value   at   the   end   3rd   year   =   Rs.40,000   
Growth   Rate   -   16.96%   
Tenure   -   1   yearExpected   value   =   40,000*(1+16.96%)   -   >   I'm   basically  
incrementing   40,000   by   16.96%   
zerodha.com/varsity    
228    

229    
=   Rs.46,784.28/-   
Let   us   twist   this   a   bit,   what   is   the   likely   investment   value   if   I   let   this  
investment   run   for   three   more   years?   
The   formula   is   
Current   value   *(   1+   growth   rate)^(time   in   year)   
=   40000*(1+16.96%)^(3)   
=   Rs.64,000/-   
This   is   also   called   the   future   value   of   the   investment   given   a   certain   growth  
rate.   
I   hope   you   now   appreciate   why   we   need   to   consider   the   CAGR   and   not  
absolute   return   if   the   investment   is   more   than   one   year.   
One   last   thing   you   need   to   note   -   Higher   the   average   speed,   faster   you   will  
reach   your   destination.   High   speed   also   comes   with   high   risk.   Likewise,  
higher   the   CAGR,   higher   is   the   rate   at   which   your   investment   is   growing.   The  
risk   too   is   high   in   such   investments   as   there   could   be   fears   of   a   crash   in   the  
underlying   asset   prices.   
Anyway,   I   hope   you   are   now   clear   about   the   distinction   between   absolute  
return   and   CAGR   and   when   to   use   which   one.   
We   will   now   shi   focus   on   XIRR,   which   is   applicable   when   we   do   SIP   over  
multiple   years.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
229    

230    
XIRR   stands   for   Extended   Internal   Rate   of   Return.   XIRR   comes   in   handy   when  
you   make   regular   investments   in   a   mutual   fund   over   an   extended   period.  
Hence   for   SIPs,   you   need   to   use   XIRR   to   measure   the   growth   rate.   
Assume   you   invest   Rs.5,000/-   on   10th   of   every   month   in   a   mutual   fund.   You  
started   the   investment   process   in   December   2018;   you   continued   to   do   so   till  
June   2020.   The   SIP   table   looks   like   this   -   
 
So   across   19   months,   Rs.95,000/-   has   been   invested.   The   investment   amount  
is   within   the   bracket   to   indicate   that   it   is   a   cash   outflow   from   your   bank  
account.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
230    

231    
Now,   as   on   today,   i.e.   10th   July   2020,   the   value   of   this   investment   is  
Rs.1,10,000/-.   Question   is   what   the   growth   rate   is?   Of   course,   you   can  
calculate   the   absolute   return   here.   Still,   hopefully,   by   now,   you   should  
recognize   that   this   is   a   multi-year   investment   and   absolute   return   does   not  
serve   any   purpose.   
The   traditional   CAGR   also   does   not   help   because   there   are   multiples  
investments   across   multiple   periods.   However,   we   still   use   CAGR,   but   with  
slight   modifications.   One   can   say   that   XIRR   is   a   modified   version   of   CAGR  
which   accommodates   for   staggered   investments.   
The   XIRR   formula   is   quite   intimidating.   I'd   suggest   you   do   a   Google   image  
search   with   'XIRR   Formula'   as   the   keyword   and   you'll   know   what   I'm   referring  
too.   But   luckily   we   need   not   have   to   apply   that   formula.   
MS   Excel   has   an   XIRR   function   that   you   can   use.   The   function   itself   is   quite 
straightforward   to   use   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
231    

232    
 
If   you   notice,   I've   included   the   current   value   of   the   investment,   I   have  
highlighted   this   in   bold   (above   the   arrow   mark).   The   number   is   not   in  
brackets   to   indicate   the   fact   that   I   can   get   this   as   positive   cash   flow   into   my  
bank   account   if   I   decide   to   exit   the   investment   today.   
The   excel   function   to   calculate   XIRR   requires   two   inputs   -   
1. The   series   of   cash   outflows   and   the   current   value   of   the   investment   
       2.   The   respective   dates   of   cash   flow   and   the   date   of   the   current   value   
zerodha.com/varsity    
232

Once   you   feed   these   inputs,   excel   does   what   it   is   supposed   to   do   and   throws  
out   the   XIRR   or   the   growth   rate   number   for   you   -   
 
As   you   can   see,   the   growth   rate   or   the   XIRR   is   18.79%.   
Now,   if   you   scroll   up,   you   will   see   that   I   mentioned   that   you   could   use   XIRR   for  
returns   for   less   than   one   year,   but   it's   non-intuitive,   therefore   its   better   to  
sticks   to   absolute   return.   
Let   me   demonstrate   why   so.   Have   a   look   at   this   -   
zerodha.com/varsity

 
This   is   a   SIP   of   Rs.5,000/-   for   five   months.   The   total   investment   is   Rs.25,000/-.  
Assume   the   current   value   on   10th   May   2019   is   Rs.30,000/-.   If   I   compute   the  
XIRR   for   this   -   
 
XIRR   tells   me   that   the   investment   has   returned   106%.   Do   you   think   this   is  
intuitive?   I   don't   think   so,   because   a   regular   MF   investor   sees   a   gain   of   5,000  
over   a   25,000   investment.   It   will   be   very   hard   to   convince   him   that   the   growth  
rate   of   his   investment   is   106%.   
Hence,   for   this   reason,   most   platforms   show   the   absolute   return   for   SIPs   less  
than   a   year,   rather   than   XIRR.   In   this   case,   the   absolute   return   is   20%,   which   is  
intuitive   for   the   vast   majority.   
18.3   -   XIRR   and   CAGR   are   the   same   
zerodha.com/varsity    
234    

235    
I   would   like   to   discuss   one   last   thing   about   XIRR   and   CAGR.   I   mentioned   that  
XIRR   is   a   modified   version   of   CAGR.   Both   XIRR   and   CAGR   serve   the   same  
purpose,   i.e.   to   measure   the   rate   of   return   over   a   multi-year   period.   
It's   just   that   XIRR   comes   in   handy   when   we   have   a   SIP   kind   of   investment  
situation.   Now,   if   you   think   about   it,   then   XIRR   and   CAGR   should   yield   the  
same   result   for   a   lumpsum   investment   made   over   one   year.   
Let's   take   an   example   -   
Investment   date   -   3rd   Jan   2018   
Investment   amount   -   Rs.1,00,000/-   
Today's   date   -   3rd   Jan   2020   
Current   value   of   investment   -   Rs.1,25,000/-   
The   CAGR   works   out   to   -   
[1,25,000/1,00,000]^(1/2)-1   
=   11.8%   
If   you   run   the   XIRR   function   on   the   same   set   of   numbers   -   
 
You   get   the   same   answer.   I   hope   you   get   the   logic   behind   XIRR   and   CAGR.   

I'd   want   you   to   do   an   exercise   as   a   follow-up   activity.   Please   visit   an   AMC  
website,   or   visit   coin.zerodha.com,   pick   a   fund   and   observe   how   the   returns  
are   mentioned.   You   should   now   be   in   a   position   to   understand   what   is   being  
reported   and   what   the   returns   mean.   

Key   takeaways   from   this   chapter   
1. For   lumpsum   investments   less   than   one   year,   use   absolute  
return   
2. For   SIP   investments   less   than   one   year,   use   absolute   return   
3. For   lumpsum   investments   over   a   year   use   CAGR   
4. For   SIP   investments   over   a   year,   use   XIRR   
5. CAGR   is   the   growth   rate   of   an   investment   
6. XIRR   is   a   modified   form   of   CAGR   
7. CAGR   and   XIRR   are   same   for   lumpsum   investments   over   1   year   

CHAPTER    19   
Rolling   Returns    
 
19.1   -   Point   to   Point   return    
The   previous   chapter   gave   us   a   perspective   of   how   returns   are   calculated  
given   the   time   frame   under   consideration.   So,   now   if   I   were   to   provide   you  
with   the   following   data   point   -    
Fund   -   Aditya   Birla   Frontline   Equity   
Starting   date   -   2nd   January   2013   
Starting   investment   value   -   Rs.1,00,000/-   
Starting   NAV   -   100.83   
Ending   date   -   2nd   January   2015   
Ending   NAV   -   161.83    
And   asked   to   find   out   the   returns,   you'd   probably   do   it   with   ease.   Let   us   do  
the   math   -    
Number   of   units   =   1,00,000/   100.83 
=   991.7683 
The   ending   value   of   investment    =   991.7683   *   161.83   
=   Rs.1,60,497.9   
zerodha.com/varsity    
237    

238    
The   growth   in   this   lumpsum   investment   over   two   years   can   be   calculated   by  
applying   the    CAGR   formula   -    
=   [160497.9/100000]^(1/2)   -   1   
=26.69%.    
Which   as   would   recognize   is   a   phenomenal   growth   rate.    
Now,   let   us   say   you   are   mighty   impressed   with   your   investment,   and   you   start  
to   propagate   the   fund.   A   friend   walks   up   to   you   asks   for   the   performance,   and  
you   proudly   declare   the   2-year   growth   rate   is   26.96%.    
Your   friend   is   impressed   and   decides   to   invest.    
Now,   I   want   you   to   think   about   this   for   a   moment.   What   do   you   think   is   the  
fundamental   flaw   here?    
Did   you   lie   about   your   investment   to   your   friend?   -   No   
Did   you   lie   or   mislead   your   friend   by   letting   him   know   the   returns   you've  
enjoyed?   -   No   
Well,   then   what   do   you   think   is   wrong   here?   
The   growth   rate   of   26.96%   is   a   massive   generalization   of   two-year   growth  
rate.   When   you   mentioned   this   return   to   your   friend   would   believe   that   this   is  
the   kind   of   performance   even   he   is   likely   to   enjoy.    
The   26.96%   return   is   valid   when   the   money   is   invested   on   2nd   January   2013  
and   measure   its   growth   on   2nd   January   2015.   In   other   words,   the   growth   rate  
is   really   only   for   this   starting   and   ending   points;   it   is   right   for   these   exact   two  
dates.    It   is   a   very   personalized   experience.    
zerodha.com/varsity    
238    

239    
If   I   were   to   invest   and   measure   the   returns   on   any   other   dates,   then   the  
profits   will   be   diﬀerent.    
So,   whenever   you   measure   returns   or   growth   between   two   dates,   the   value  
you   calculate   is   only   valid   for   the   two   years   under   consideration.   Hence,   such  
a   measurement   of   returns   is   also   called   the   'Point   to   point'   return.    
To   get   an   accurate   representation   of   how   the   two-year   return   (growth   rate)  
looks,   you   need   to   calculate   the   'Rolling   Returns'.    
19.2   -   Rolling   Return      
The   rolling   return   gives   us   a   perspective   of   how   the   'n   years'   return   (growth)  
has   evolved   over   the   last   'n   years'.    Sounds   confusing?   I'm   sure   it   is,   so   here   is  
what   we   will   do.    
 
We   will   take   up   an   example   and   figure   out   the   rolling   return   calculation.   I'm  
sure   understanding   the   rolling   return   concept   becomes   much   easier   if   you  
know   the   math   behind.    
zerodha.com/varsity    
239    

240    
By   the   way,   many   websites   publish   the   mutual   fund's   rolling   return,   so   it   is  
not   essential   to   remember   how   to   calculate   the   rolling   returns.   However,   by  
knowing   the   rolling   returns   math,   you   will   understand   the   concept   of   rolling  
return   quite   easily.    
So   let   us   get   started.    
I've   got   the   historical   NAV   data   of   AB   Frontline   Equity   Growth-Direct.   The  
starting   date   is   from   2nd   January   2013,   and   I've   got   this   till   2nd   January   2020,  
that's   about   seven   years   of   data.    
 
zerodha.com/varsity    
240    

241    
My   objective   here   is   to   find   out   the   2-year   rolling   return   for   this   fund.   To   do  
this,   I'll   have   to   start   in   2015.    
I   take   the   NAV   on   2nd   January   2015   and   the   NAV   2   years   ago,   i.e.   on   2nd  
January   2013   and   calculate   the   return   between   these   two   data   points.   Next,   I  
move   the   date   by   one   day,   i.e.   between   3rd   January   2015   and   3rd   January  
2013,   take   the   NAV   for   these   two   dates   and   calculate   the   return   between  
these   dates.   I'll   again   move   the   date   by   one   day,   i.e.   4th   January   2015/2013  
and   calculate   the   return.    
So   on   and   so   forth,   such   that   I   have   a   time   series   of   2-year   return.    
Let   us   calculate   the   first   rolling   return   -    
NAV   on   2nd   January   2013   -   100.83   
NAV   on   2nd   January   2015   -   161.83   
Since   its   two   years,   we   apply   CAGR   -    
[161.83/100.83]^(1/2)-1   
26.69%   
The   2nd   rolling   return   in   this   series   would   be   -    
NAV   on   3rd   January   2013   -   101.29   
NAV   on   3rd   January   2015   -   161.45   
=[161.45/101.29]^(1/2)-1   
26.25%   
zerodha.com/varsity    
241    

242    
I   suppose   you   get   the   sequence.   I've   stacked   up   the   data   side   by   side   on   excel,  
and   this   is   how   it   looks   -    
 
The   starting   date   is   2nd   January   2015,   right   up   to   2nd   January   2020.    
As   you   can   see,   I   have   the   latest   date   and   NAV   (shaded   in   blue).   Next   to   this,   I  
have   the   date   and   NAV   for   two   years   ago   (shaded   in   pale   yellow).   I   have  
calculated   the   CAGR   against   these   two   NAVs.   If   I   do   the   CAGR   across   all   the  
dates,   I   get   a   time   series   of   the   daily   2-year   return   starting   from   2nd   January  
2015.    
Before   we   proceed,   let   us   look   at   this   statement   about   rolling   return   again   -  
'Rolling   return   gives   us   a   perspective   of   how   the   'n   years'   return   (growth)   has  
evolved   over   the   last   'n   years'.   Does   this   sound   confusing   now?   
zerodha.com/varsity    
242    

243    
I   hope   not   ☺    
Anyway,   one   minor   thing   to   note   here   -   look   at   the   2nd   data   point,   I   have   NAV  
for   5th   January   2015,   but   I   don't   have   the   NAV   for   5th   January   2013,   but  
instead   have   the   NAV   data   for   3rd   January   2013,   which   I've   used.   As   you   may  
have   guessed,   this   happens   due   to   the   weekend   factor.   So   I'd   suggest   you  
ignore   this   bit.    
Also,   at   this   point,   you   should   realize   that   if   my   objective   were   to   calculate   the 
1-year   rolling   return,   my   starting   point   would   be   2014,   and   if   the   objective   is  
to   estimate   three   years   rolling   return,   then   I   would   start   from   2016.    
Now   that   we   have   the   Rolling   Return   time   series   starting   from   2015,   I   can   do   a  
couple   of   things   with   the   data.   To   begin   with,   we   can   calculate   the   range   of  
returns   for   the   time   series   we   have   calculated.   To   estimate   the   range,   we  
simply   have   to   calculate   the   max   and   min.    
Here   is   the   max   -    

244    
And   here   is   the   min   -    
 
What   does   this   mean?   Well,   assume   two   people   invested   in   the   AB   Frontline  
Equity   fund.   The   lucky   person   invested   on   19th   August   2013   and   pulled   out  
his   investment   on   19th   August   2015.   This   person   makes   37.76%.    
The   unlucky   fellow   also   invested   for   two   years,   but   he/she   invested   on   19th  
September   2017   and   stayed   invested   till   19th   September   2019.   Unfortunately,  
this   person   lost   money!    
The   point   that   I'm   trying   to   make   is   that   no   two,   2-year   returns   are   the   same.  
The   returns   change   depending   on   when   you   choose   to   invest   and   when   you  
decide   to   pull   out   your   investment.    
Here   is   a   graph   of   the   rolling   2-year   return   starting   from   2015.    
zerodha.com/varsity    
244    

245    
 
And   as   you   can   see,   the   two-year   returns   have   ranged   from   37%   to   nearly  
-1.0%.   If   you   were   to   invest   for   two   years,   then   your   return   could   have   been  
anywhere   within   this   range.    
To   get   a   perspective   of   the   likely   2-year   return,   you   can   take   an   average   of   the  
rolling   returns;   this   is   called   the   'Rolling   Return   Average'.    
The   average   is   15.35%.    
So   as   you   can   see,   the   rolling   return   gives   us   a   lot   more   insights   compared   to  
a   point   to   point   return.    
So   the   next   time   you   want   to   invest   in   a   mutual   fund,   as   a   part   of   the   analysis,  
include   these   two   things   -    
1. Identify   the   period   you   are   interested   in   investing   
2. Find   out   the   historical   rolling   return   min,   max,   and   average   for   the  
period   

For   example,   if   I'm   looking   at   investing   in   a   large-cap   equity   fund   for   seven  
years,   I'll   check   the   historical   7-year   rolling   return   for   that   particular   fund.   By  
doing   so,   I   will   get   a   perspective   of   historical   return   range   plus   its   average.    
In   my   opinion,   this   is   much   better   than   looking   at   a   point   to   point   return.   By  
the   way,   I've   used   2   years   rolling   return   as   an   example.   If   you   are   looking   at  
investing   in   EQ   funds,   then   please   consider   at   least   5   years   rolling   returns   or  
higher.    
In   the   next   chapter,   let   us   discuss   other   MF   metrics   that   matter.      
Key   takeaways   from   this   chapter   
1. Point   to   point   return   gives   a   perspective   of   the   return   only   for  
the   two   days   under   consideration    
2. Point   to   point   return   should   not   be   taken   as   a   generalization   of  
return    
3. The   rolling   return   gives   a   better   perspective   of   the   return   
4. Rolling   return   average   is   a   better   representation   of   the   returns  
one   can   expect   

CHAPTER    20   
Mutual   fund   Expense   Ratio,   Direct,   and   Regular  
plans   
 
20.1   -   Expense   Ratio   
In   the   last   chapter,   we   discussed   the   'Rolling   Returns',   and   why   rolling   returns  
oﬀer   a   better   insight   into   the   return   pattern   compared   to   a   simple   point   to  
point   return.   Continuing   from   the   previous   chapter,   we   will   discuss   a   few  
more   important   metrics   related   to   mutual   funds.   
In   this   chapter,   we   focus   on   the   expense   ratio   of   a   mutual   fund.   Of   course,   this  
is   the   20th   chapter   in   this   module,   and   I   suppose   we   have   mentioned  
'expense   ratio',   in   passing   multiples   times.   However,   we   never   formally  
introduced   the   concept   of   the   expense   ratio   of   a   mutual   fund.   So   let   us   do  
that   before   we   proceed.   
Think   about   services   like   Tata   Sky,   Netflix,   Swiggy,   or   even   Dunzo,   these   are  
all   services   that   you   consume   fairly   regularly   (I   assume)   and   therefore   you  
pay   for   it.   Why   would   you   pay   for   it?   Well,   because   there   is   a   real   cost 
involved.   For   example,   a   Dunzo   executive   has   to   ride   his   bike   to   the   store,   pick  
up   the   item,   deliver   the   same   to   your   house.   So   there   is   fuel,   labour,   tech,   and  
other   expenses   involved.   Hence   we   pay   a   fee   to   cover   for   these   costs   plus   a  
tiny   bit   extra   which   adds   to   the   profit   of   the   company.   

Likewise,   managing   your   investments   in   a   Mutual   Fund   is   also   a   service   and  
the   service   is   oﬀered   by   the   Asset   Management   Company   (AMC),   and  
needless   to   say,   you   have   to   pay   for   it.   
The   fee   mutual   fund   charges   are   called,   'The   Total   Expense   Ratio'   or   TER.   
Why   do   the   AMCs   charge?   Well,   they   have   expenses   to   bear   -   custodian   fees,  
Trustee,   RTAs,   fund   managers,   admin,   brokers,   distributors,   advertisements,  
and   of   course,   as   a   business,   they   need   to   be   profitable   too.   
At   this   point,   there   are   two   possible   paths   available   to   us   -   deep   dive   into  
what,   why,   how   of   TER   or   get   a   working   knowledge   of   TER.   
I   prefer   we   stick   to   the   later.   As   a   Mutual   fund   investor,   all   you   need   to   be  
aware   of   is   that   mutual   fund   investments   are   not   free,   and   you   have   to   pay   for  
it.   
However,   most   of   the   first   time   investors   would   like   to   believe   that   mutual  
fund   investments   are   free   because   they   never   make   an   explicit   payment   to   an  
AMC   for   the   fund   management   services.   In   fact,   no   one   explicitly   pays   an  
AMC.   
The   service   fee,   i.e.   the   TER   is   charged   in   a   very   convenient   and   hassle-free  
manner,   so   much   so   that   you   wouldn't   even   know   you've   paid   for   it   J.   
As   a   mutual   fund   investor,   all   you   need   to   know   is   -   
● How   is   the   fee   charged?   
● How   much   is   the   fee   charged?   
● Techniques   to   save   on   TER.   
zerodha.com/varsity

249    
I'll   use   a   very   simplified   example   and   address   these   questions.   The   idea   is   to  
give   you   rough   working   knowledge   on   TER   and   not   the   exact   math   behind.   
Assume   a   certain   AMC   charges   a   TER   of   1%,   i.e.   a   fee   of   Rs.1,000/-   per   year   for  
every   Rs.1,00,000/-   invested.   Now,   this   fee   is   not   collected   from   you   the  
moment   you   invest   or   on   a   monthly/quarterly/half-yearly   or   yearly   basis.   The  
fee   is   collected   from   you   daily,   without   even   you   being   aware   of   it.   
Let   me   explain   -   
Rs.1,000/-   is   the   charge   on   an   annual   basis.   If   you   do   the   math,   this   works   out  
to   -   
1,0000/365   
=Rs.2.73/-   
So   as   long   as   you   are   invested,   Rs.2.73/-   is   deducted   from   your   funds   daily.  
The   question   is,   how   do   they   charge   and   take   this   money   on   a   daily   basis.   
Assume   the   starting   NAV   of   the   fund   is   Rs.10/-.   Since   you've   invested  
Rs.1,00,000/-   you   are   entitled   to   receive   
=   Rs.1,00,000/10   
=   10,000   units.   
Aer   you   invest,   assume   the   very   next   day   the   fund   gains   1%.   That   means,   the  
new   NAV   is   -   
=10*(1+1%)   
=   10.1   
zerodha.com/varsity    
249    

250    
And   the   value   of   your   investment   is   
=   10.1   *   10,000   
=   Rs.1,01,000/-   
However,   the   AMC   needs   Rs.2.73/-   from   you   as   a   fee.   Hence   they   will   deduct  
this   money   from   the   value   of   your   investment   =   
Rs.1,01,000/-   minus    Rs.2.73/-   
=   Rs.1,00,997.3/-   
Or   the   actual   NAV   applicable   (and   declared)   is   -   
=   Rs.1,00,997.3   /   10,000   
=   10.09973.   
Note,   the   NAV   is   10.09973   aer   deducting   the   TER.   Before   TER   the   NAV   is   10.1.   
So   the   point   to   note   is   - 
● The   NAV   that   is   declared   is   aer   deducting   the   TER   
● The   money   is   collected   from   you   from   your   investments   
● Money   is   deducted   daily   
Now   in   the   example,   we   worked   with   the   assumption   that   the   value   of   the  
investments   increases   by   1%.   Even   if   the   value   of   the   fund   decreased,   the  
fund   will   still   go   ahead   and   charge   what   they   are   supposed   to   charge.   
Besides,   there   are   plenty   of   nuances   to   TER   calculation.   For   instance,   SEBI  
has   mandated   the   maximum   TER   a   fund   can   levy   over   an   Equity   and   Debt  
zerodha.com/varsity    
250    

251    
fund.   SEBI   has   also   proposed   a   maximum   TER   proportionate   to   the   fund  
asset   under   management   for   a   given   scheme.   The   fund   should   also   consider  
the   weighted   average   sum   of   your   investments.   So   as   you   can   imagine,   there  
are   many   subtleties   involved.   
There   are   professional   'fund   accounting'   companies   which   incorporate   the  
SEBI   guidelines   and   help   the   AMCs   do   the   math   and   ascertain   the   TER   on   a  
weighted   average   basis.   As   an   investor,   I   don't   think   it   is   necessary   to   dwell  
into   these   technicalities   as   long   as   you   know   much   you   are   paying.   
Also,   when   you   are   selecting   a   fund   for   investment,   the   TER   is   not   a  
standalone   factor   to   consider.   TER   is   no   doubt   important,   but   just   because   a  
fund   is   charging   say   2%,   you   should   not   ignore   everything   else   about   the  
fund   and   decide   not   to   invest.   
Yes,   if   you   have   to   shortlist   between   two   funds   of   the   same   type   including   the  
return   profile,   for   example,   an   overnight   fund,   then   it   makes   sense   to   look   at  
the   fund   with   a   lower   TER   and   invest   in   it.   
Now,   here   is   a   snapshot   of   the   UTI   Core   Equity   fund   and   the   TER   it   charges   -   
 
zerodha.com/varsity    
251    

252    
As   you   can   see,   the   fund   charges   2.11%   for   Direct   plan   and   2.39%   for   the  
regular   plan.   
Now   the   obvious   question   -   what   is   the   diﬀerence   between   direct   and   regular  
plan   and   why   two   diﬀerent   TER   for   these   funds.   
20.2   -   Direct   and   Regular   plans    
If   you   are   a   90's   kid,   growing   up   in   Bangalore,   then   you'd   probably   remember 
a   few   ice   cream   brands   -   Vadilal,   Dollops,   Kwality,   and   Joy.   My   favourite   was  
Joy   Ice   cream,   not   because   it   was   any   diﬀerent   than   Vadilal,   but   because   the  
Joy   Ice   cream   factory   was   500   meters   from   my   house.   
It   was   a   small   factory   with   a   little   retail   outlet   at   the   factory's   entrance.   At   this  
factory-owned   retail   outlet,   a   choco   bar   stick   was   sold   at   Rs.14/-   whereas   the  
same   was   sold   at   Rs.18/-   in   a   shop   called   'Anu   stores',   which   still   is   about   1km  
away.   Whenever   my   parents   felt   generous,   they   would   give   me   some   money  
to   buy   ice   creams;   I'd   run   to   the   factory   retail   shop   and   pick   up   a   couple   of   ice  
cream   sticks   for   the   family.   While   the   kids   were   happy   with   the   ice   cream,   my  
folks   were   happy   with   the   savings.   

Good   old   days   
🙂
   
Now,   why   do   you   think   the   factory   sold   the   ice   cream   at   Rs.14/-   while   Anu  
stores   sold   the   same   ice   cream   at   Rs.18?   
Well,   because   the   owner   of   Anu   stores   needed   an   incentive   to   sell   Joy   ice  
cream.   Without   the   incentive,   why   would   anyone   sell   a   product,   right?   That's  
the   reason   Joy   Ice   cream   as   a   company   would   mark   up   the   price   to   include  
the   shop   owners   incentive   and   sell   the   choco   bar   at   Rs.18/-.   
However,   at   the   factor's   retail   outlet,   there   is   no   incentive   because   the   Joy   Ice  
cream   as   a   company   would   make   whatever   it   had   to   make   by   selling   the   ice  
cream   directly   to   the   customer   at   Rs.14/-.   
I   suppose   this   is   a   simple   business   model   to   understand.   
Same   goes   with   Mutual   Funds.   
You   can   choose   to   buy   Mutual   Funds   in   two   ways   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
253    

254    
● From   the   AMC   directly 
● Via   a   distributor   
When   you   buy   a   mutual   fund   directly   from   the   AMC,   it   is   called   a   'Direct'  
transaction.   The   direct   transaction   is   comparable   to   me   buying   the   ice   creme  
from   the   factory   owned   retail   outlet.   
However,   if   you   buy   a   mutual   fund   from   a   distributor,   then   it   is   comparable   to  
buying   the   ice   cream   from   Anu   stores.   
Now   the   seller   of   a   regular   mutual   fund   needs   an   incentive   to   sell   the   mutual  
fund;   hence   the   AMC   marks   up   the   TER   and   passes   the   additional   TER    to   the  
distributor   and   the   distributor   network.   Hence,   for   any   given   fund,   the   TER   or  
the   expense   ratio   for   a   regular   fund   will   always   be   higher   compared   to   the  
direct   fund.   
Which   leads   us   to   an   important   point   -   every   mutual   fund   scheme   is   available  
in   two   avatars   or   two   plans   -   
● Direct   Plan   
● Regular   Plan   
While   everything   remains   the   same,   only   the   TER   changes.   Have   a   look   at   the  
snapshot   below;   I've   taken   this   from   HDFC   AMC   website   -   
 
zerodha.com/varsity    
254    

255    
As   you   can   see   above,   we   are   looking   at   the   HDFC   Top   100   Fund   (Growth).  
There   are   two   variants   available   to   you   -   Direct   and   regular.   The   first   in   the   list  
is   the   direct   plan,   where   they   have   explicitly   mentioned   that   it   is   a   direct   plan.  
The   second   in   the   list   is   the   regular   plan.   The   AMC   has   not   explicitly  
mentioned   that   it   is   a   regular   plan,   but   is   implied.   
The   TER   for   both   these   funds   is   diﬀerent.   Here   is   the   snapshot   -   
 
The   TER   for   Direct   is   1.28%,   and   Regular   is   1.78%.   The   additional   TER   of   0.5%  
in   the   regular   fund   is   to   ensure   the   distributor   is   adequately   compensated   for  
selling   the   Mutual   Fund.   
It   is   very   important   to   comprehend   the   fact   that   the   TER   is   paid   by   you,   i.e.  
the   investor   to   the   AMC   and   therefore   the   distributor.   
When   you   buy   from   the   AMC   directly,   there   is   no   distributor,   hence   no  
distributor   commission,   hence   lesser   TER.   The   lesser   the   TER,   the   higher   the 
returns   for   you.   
At   this   stage,   you   may   be   clear   about   the   fact   that   the   TER   for   regular   funds   is  
higher   compared   to   its   direct   counterpart.   You   may   have   also   understood   the  
fact   that   the   fund   is   the   same   -   same   strategy,   same   portfolio,   same   fund  
manager,   same   risk,   etc.,   but   the    TER   or   the   expense   ratio   is   diﬀerent.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
255    

256    
The   diﬀerence   in   TER   is   mainly   to   incentivize   the   Mutual   fund   agent   or   the  
mutual   fund   distributor   to   sell   the   AMCs   fund.   You   may   have   a   couple   of 
questions   by   now   -   
● Who   are   these   'MF   agents   or   distributors'   trying   to   convince   you   to   buy  
regular   plans?   
● Why   would   anyone   opt   for   regular   funds   given   that   these   have   higher  
TER?   
● If   the   two   funds   are   same,   then   why   is   the   NAV   of   direct   fund   higher  
compared   to   the   NAV   of   the   regular   fund   (refer   to   the   snapshot   above)   
The   MF   agents   could   be   your   local   bank   manager   or   that   annoying   uncle   who  
always   turns   up   on   Sunday   mornings   to   try   to   sell   some   'financial   scheme'.  
The   distributor   could   be   an   online   website   as   well,   where   you   buy   the   mutual  
fund   yourself.   
Regardless   of   who   the   distributor   is,   you   need   to   remember   that   when   you  
buy   a   regular   MF,   you   are   paying   a   higher   TER   fee.   
Does   that   mean   buying   a   regular   plan   and   paying   a   higher   TER   is   bad? 
Well,   no.   
If   you   know   nothing   about   Mutual   fund   investment,    and   you   need   help   with  
this,   then   you   should   opt   for   an   advisor   who   will   advise   and   keep   track   of  
everything   on   your   behalf   (markets,   MF   performance,   rebalancing   etc.).  
Under   such   a   circumstance,   it   makes   sense   to   buy   a   regular   MF   from   the  
agent   to   compensate   him   or   her   for   the   advisory   work   and   the   continuous  
hand   holding   services.   

However,   if   you   are   comfortable   dealing   with   Mutual   funds   (which   hopefully  
is   the   case   because   you   are   reading   this   module),   then   it   does   not   make   sense  
to   opt   for   a   regular   fund.   You   are   better   oﬀ   investing   in   a   direct   fund   and   save  
on   costs.   
Hopefully,   this   explains   who   these   distributors   are   and   why   one   should   opt   or  
not   opt   for   regular   funds.   
The   last   question,   i.e.   why   the   NAV   of   direct   funds   is   higher   compared   to   a  
regular   fund   is   perhaps   the   most   asked   question.   
The   confusion   is   this   -   the   NAV   of   the   regular   fund   is   lesser.   Hence   the   units  
are   available   for   a   cheaper   price,   why   pay   more   for   the   direct   fund   given   the  
fact   that   the   NAV   for   direct   funds   is   higher.   
For   example,   look   at   the   NAVs   for   HDFC   Top   100   fund   -   
● Direct   plan   NAV   is   460.5   
● Regular   plan   NAV   is   438.4   
The   diﬀerence   is   almost   Rs.22/-   per   unit.   It   is   only   natural   to   want   to   buy   the  
regular   fund   considering   it   is   cheaper.   
Well,   the   problem   is   in   the   way   we   perceive   the   NAV.   If   you   look   at   NAV   as   a  
price   you   pay   to   acquire   the   mutual   fund,   then,   yes,   the   regular   fund   NAV  
looks   cheaper,   and   it   seems   like   a    smart   decision   to   pay   a   lesser   amount   and  
buy   the   regular   plan.   
However,   if   you   look   at   the   NAV   not   as   an   asset   price,   but   rather   as   the   value  
of   an   asset,   then   you   will   soon   realise   that   the   regular   plan   is   less   valuable  
zerodha.com/varsity    
257    

258    
compared   to   the   direct   plan.   Aer   all,   the   NAV   stands   for   'Net   Asset   Value',   and  
not   'Net   Asset   price',   I   hope   you   get   the   subtle   diﬀerence   
🙂
   
Think   of   NAV   as   of   the   latest   value   of   the   asset   you've   acquired.   
In   the   next   chapter,   we   will   continue   to   discuss   a   few   more   mutual   fund  
metrics.   
Key   takeaways   from   this   chapter   
● Investment   in   Mutual   fund   is   not   free;   there   is   a   fee   applicable.   
● The   applicable   fee   is   called   the   'Total   Expense   Ratio'   or   simply  
the   expense   ratio   
● The   TER   is   expressed   as   an   annual   percentage   charged   
● The   TER   is   charged   daily   
● The   NAV   that   is   declared   is   posted   TER   deduction   
● For   a   given   fund,   TER   for   the   direct   plan   is   lesser   compared   to  
the   regular   plan   
● For   a   given   fund,   the   NAV   for   the   regular   plan   is   always   lesser  
compared   to   the   direct   plan   

CHAPTER    21   
Mutual    Benchmarking   
  
21.1   -   TER   savings    
I   probably   should   have   discussed   this   in   the   last   chapter   itself,   but   don't   know  
why   (and   how   I   missed   it).   While   we   discussed   TER,   Direct,   and   Regular   plans,  
I   should   have   perhaps   given   you   an   indication   of   how   much   one   can   save   by  
opting   for   a   direct   plan.   So   before   we   discuss   mutual   fund   benchmarking,   lets  
quickly   address   the   savings   bit.   Also,   this   is   my   last   attempt   to   convince   you  
to   switch   to   direct   MF   investment   as   opposed   to   regular   MF.    
You   can   do   this   little   experiment   yourself.    
Pick   any   Mutual   fund   of   your   choice.   I've   picked   IDFC   Core   Equity   Fund,  
Growth.   Arbitrarily   assume   a   starting   date   and   a   SIP   amount,   I've   picked  
Rs.10,000/-   as   the   monthly   SIP   amount,   starting   from   1st   Jan   2014.   I   further  
assumed   that   the   SIP   is   continued   over   five   years,   i.e.   till   1st   Jan   2020.      
I've   used   a   standard   SIP   calculator   (I've   used   the   one   on   Moneycontrol)   to   see  
the   performance   of   the   SIP   in   this   fund.   Here   is   the   result   -    
zerodha.com/varsity    
259    



260    
 
There   are   a   couple   of   things   you   will   notice   here   -    
1. The   CAGR   (or   XIRR   to   be   particular)   is   8.84%   
2. The   total   amount   invested   is   Rs.7,30,000/-   across   73   months.    
3. The   total   number   of   units   acquired   is   20,772.43    
4. The   value   of   the   investment   aer   73   months   of   regular   investment   is  
Rs.9,52,000/-    
This   is   a   reasonably   standard   SIP   performance.   Now,   repeat   the   same   activity  
with   the   same   fund,   but   in   the   direct   option,   i.e.   IDFC   Core   Equity   Fund,  
Direct,   Growth.    
zerodha.com/varsity    
260    

261    
Here   is   how   the   performance   looks   like   -    
 
Contract   the   performance   of   the   direct   option   with   the   regular   option.   I've  
tabulated   this   for   you   so   that   it's   easy   for   you   to   compare   -    
 
zerodha.com/varsity

262    
In   the   direct   fund,   you   would   have   accumulated   19,982   units,   slightly   lesser  
than   regular   funds.   But   do   recall   from   the   previous   chapter,   the   value   of   units  
in   direct   funds   is   always   much   higher   compared   to   the   regular   fund.    
As   you   can   see,   the   investment   value   in   direct   is   Rs.9,99,527/-   versus   the   value  
of   Rs.9,52,000/-   in   the   regular   fund.    
The   diﬀerence   is   Rs.47,527/-   or   about   6.51%   when   compared   to   the   initial  
investment   amount.   Where   do   you   think   this   money   is   going?    
Well,   the   money   is   going   to   the   distributor   for   having   advised   you   to   start   a  
10,000/-   SIP   five   years   ago.    
Now   obviously   in   the   direct   fund,   the   distributor   does   not   make   this  
commission.   Hence   the   returns   are   higher,   this   is   quite   evident   when   you   look  
at   the   XIRR   as   well   -   10.47%   Direct   Fund   XIRR   versus   Regular   plan's   8.84%.    
Which   implies,   that   every   year   you   end   up   paying   1.63%   of   your   investment  
value   as   commissions.   
Do   yourself   a   favour,   and   please   switch   to   direct   funds   
😊
    
21.2   -   Benchmarking   and   TRI   
Moving   forward,   I   guess   we   need   to   spend   some   time   to   discuss   the   concept  
of   'Benchmarking',   in   mutual   funds.    
Benchmarking,   in   the   mutual   fund   world,   is   used   to   measure   the  
performance   of   a   fund.   To   put   this   in   perspective,   think   about   an   aspiring  
athlete,   say   a   runner   named   'X'.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
262    

263    
X   is   practising   hard   for   an   upcoming   running   event.   X's   main   plan   is   to   not  
only   win   the   100   meters   race   but   also   beat   'Y',   another   aspiring   runner   from  
the   neighbouring   town.    
 
Now,   in   the   practice   run,   X   clears   the   100-meter   track   in   14.5   seconds.   Do   you  
think   he   is   in   a   good   position   to   win   the   race?   
It   would   be   hard   to   say   unless   we   know   how   much   time   Y   takes   to   clear   the  
same   track,   right?   Assume,   Y   takes   13   seconds.    
Now,   who   is   likely   to   win   the   race?   Y,   right?   
We   were   able   to   answer   (or   predict)   this   because   we   could   benchmark   both   X  
and   Y   against   each   other.   If   we   knew   the   speed   of   X   or   Y   without   knowing   the  
other   person's   running   speed,   then   we   couldn't   estimate   who   is   likely   to   win  
the   race.    
zerodha.com/varsity    
263    

264    
This   is   called   benchmarking.   Benchmarking   allows   us   to   measure  
performance.      
The   same   goes   with   Mutual   Funds.    
Every   mutual   fund   sets   itself   against   a   benchmark   and   aims   to   beat   that  
benchmark   in   terms   of   returns   generated.    
 
In   the   snapshot   above,   we   can   see   that   DSP's   Equity   Opportunity   Fund,  
benchmarks   itself   against   the   Niy   250   Index   (TRI).    
For   example,   a   large-cap   equity   fund   benchmarks   itself   against   the   Niy   50  
Index.   The   idea   here   being   that   the   large-cap   fund   should   beat   the   index   in  
terms   of   returns   generated   on   any   timeframe   you   choose   to   measure   -   it  
could   be   3,   5   or   10   years.   In   general   -    
1. The   MF   generates   higher   returns   than   the   benchmark;   then   the   fund   is  
said   to   outperform    
2. The   MF   generates   lower   returns   compared   to   the   benchmark;   then   the  
fund   is   said   to   have   under-performed    
zerodha.com/varsity    
264    

265    
To   put   this   in   context,   assume   an   Equity   fund   generates   12%   CAGR   across  
three   years   while   its   benchmark,   i.e.   Niy   50   generates   10.5%   for   the   same  
period.   In   this   case,   the   fund   is   said   to   have   outperformed.   The   excess   return  
with   respect   to   the   benchmark   is   called   the   'Alpha'.   
In   this   case,   the   Alpha   is   1.5%   i.e.   12%   -   10.5%.    
By   the   way,   in   the   snapshot   above,   you   must   have   noticed   the   'TRI'bit.   TRI  
stands   for   Total   Return   Index.   The   total   return   index   includes   and   factors   in  
for   dividends   as   well.   Remember,   when   you   buy   a   stock   of   a   company,   there  
are   two   sources   of   income   -    
1. Price   appreciation   or   capital   gains   
2. Dividend   income   
Now,   think   about   the   regular   index   chart   that   all   of   us   check.   This   chart  
captures   only   the   price   appreciation   of   the   index.   It   does   not   capture   the  
dividends   issued   by   the   index   constituents.   To   get   a   sense   of   real   returns   an  
investor   earns,   one   has   to   factor   in   for   the   dividends   received   by   the  
company.   The   total   returns   index   (TRI)   captures   this.   So   when   we   look   at   the  
Niy   50   chart,   we   are   essentially   looking   at   just   the   price   appreciation   chart,  
but   when   we   are   looking   at   the   Niy   50   TRI,   we   are   looking   at   both   price  
appreciation,   and   the   dividends   received.    
Have   a   look   at   a   comparison   of   Niy   50   and   Niy   50   TRI,   the   blue   line   is   TRI  
and   red   is   Niy   50   -    
zerodha.com/varsity    
265    

266    
 
For   the   same   period,   TRI   has   posted   an   absolute   return   of   942%   while   the  
Niy   50   has   posted   738%.   The   reason   why   I'm   talking   about   this   to   let   you  
know   three   things   -    
1. For   an   index,   its   TRI   avatar   is   always   more   valuable   since   it   factors   in  
dividends.    
2. MF's   use   TRI   as   a   benchmark;   this   is   a   recent   phenomenon   though.  
Earlier,   MFs   were   benchmarking   against   just   the   price   appreciation  
chart.    
3. It's   not   easy   to   beat   the   TRI   index.   
😊
    
Alright,   now   that   we   have   laid   a   foundation   for   our   discussion   for  
benchmarking,   let's   take   this   discussion   a   bit   deeper.    
 
zerodha.com/varsity

21.3   -   Weights   matter   
Consider   this,   there   are   two   mutual   fund   managers,   A   &   B.    
A   manages   a   large-cap   fund   and   benchmarks   his   funds   with   Niy   50   TRI.   B  
manages   an   Equity   multi   opportunity   fund   and   benchmarks   his   funds   against  
Niy   500   TRI.    
Which   mutual   fund   manager   here   do   you   think   will   have   a   tough   time   beating  
their   benchmark?   
Niy   50   has   50   large-cap   stock,   while   Niy   500   has   not   only   the   50   stocks   from  
Niy   50   but   an   additional   450   stocks.    
Intuitively,   it   feels   as   if   beating   the   Niy   500   TRI   seems   like   a   more  
challenging   task.   Aer   all,   Niy   500   is   diversified,   has   more   stocks,   lesser 
volatility,   and   therefore   drawdowns   are   contained.    
Well,   but   it's   not.   The   reason   for   this   is   interesting.   Let   me   explain   this.    
Imagine   you   have   created   an   imaginary   index,   call   it   the   'High   5'   index.   High  
five   consists   of   the   top   5   stocks   across   five   diﬀerent   sectors.   The   constituents  
of   the   index   are   as   follows   -    

Each   stock   has   a   certain   weight   in   the   index.   The   starting   value   of   the   index   is  
1000;   the   Base   Split   column   shows   you   the   split   of   1000   according   to   the  
weight   of   the   individual   stocks   in   the   index.    
With   this,   assume   you   start   your   index.   Aer   a   few   days,   the   stock   prices   have  
changed,   which   means   the   index   value   also   varies.   I've   randomly   assigned  
stock   price   values   to   the   High   five   index   stocks    -    
 
As   a   virtue   of   the   change   in   stock   price,   the   individual   base   values   change,  
hence   the   entire   index   changes.   Given   the   stock   price   changes,   the   overall  
index   value   changes,   and   as   you   can   see,   the   index   changed   from   1000  
(starting   price)   to   1,081.72,   representing   an   absolute   return   of   8.17%.    
Now,   let's   not   change   anything   in   the   high   five   indexes,   let   the   stocks   remain  
the   same,   the   reference   stock   prices   will   stay   the   same,   and   even   the   starting  
value   of   the   index   remains   the   same.   
We   will   only   change   the   weights   assigned   to   individual   stocks   and   see   what  
happens   to   the   index   values.   Have   a   look   at   the   snapshot   below   -    

As   you   can   see,   the   weights   have   changed.   For   example,   initially,   the   value  
assigned   to   Biocon   was   10%,   which   is   not   increased   to   20%,   Bajaj   Auto   was  
changed   to   40%   from   18%.   Likewise   for   other   stocks   as   well.    
With   the   change   in   weights,   look   at   the   new   base   value,   that   too   has   changed  
from   1,081.72   to   1,056.51.   With   no   shi   in   stocks,   but   with   a   change   in  
weights,   the   returns   have   decreased   to   5.65%   from   8.17%.    
What   does   this   mean?    
This   means   that   the   weights   you   assign   to   the   stocks   within   an   index   matter  
the   most.   Whether   you   have   50   stocks   or   500   stocks   in   the   index   is   pointless,  
what   you   need   to   look   at   it   the   weights   assigned   to   each   stock.    
For   example,   in   Niy   500,   the   top   10   stock   has   a   weightage   of   nearly   45%,   the  
top   25   has   a   weightage   close   to   65%,   top   50   has   nearly   85-90%   of   the  
weightage.    
The   rest   450   stocks   exist,   for   the   sake   of   it.   
😊
    
To   put   this   in   a   more   meaningful   context,   do   check   the   rolling   returns   of   Niy  
50   TRI   and   Niy   500   TRI.    
The   chart   below   is   the   10-year   rolling   return   of   both   Niy   50   TRI   and   Niy   500  
TRI    starting   from   2005   -   

 
And   the   one   below   is   the   5-year   rolling   return   -    
 
The   graphs   are   generated   by   my   good   friend,   Shyam   from   Stockviz.    
It's   remarkable   how   similar   these   return/drawdown   profiles   are.   There   was  
some   divergence   between   Niy   50   and   Niy   500   from   2005   to   2007,   but   that  
quickly   disappeared.   Since   then   the   returns   have   been   relatively   similar  
zerodha.com/varsity    
270    

271    
across   both   these   indices.   Again,   indicating   the   fact   that   the   additional   450  
stocks   in   Niy   500   make   very   little   diﬀerence.    
While   I've   not   discussed   other   indices   such   as   Niy   100   or   Niy   250,   you   can  
expect   something   similar.    
So   the   question   is   -   what   diﬀerence   does   it   make   if   the   benchmark   is   Niy   50  
TRI   or   Niy   500   TRI?    
Well,   nothing.    
What   does   this   mean   to   you   as   a   mutual   fund   investor?   I   suppose   some   of   you  
are   reading   this   may   have   figured   this   out   already.    
Don't   worry   too   much   about   MF   benchmarking.   You   as   an   investor,   should  
develop   a   sense   of   realistic   return   expectation   from   your   MF   investments.  
That   realistic   return   expectation   should   serve   as   your   benchmark   for   the  
investment   and   not   the   one   assigned   by   the   AMC.    
Everything   else   is   noise   according   to   me.    
Naturally,   this   further   boils   down   to   setting   realistic   return   expectations   in  
life.   For   example,   if   you've   predominantly   invested   in   a   large-cap   fund,   then  
you   should   expect   large-cap   kind   of   results   and   not   small-cap   kind   returns.  
😊
   
Having   said   that,   if   the   fund   you've   invested   in   is   under-performing   the   index  
consistently   then   that   is   not   a   good   sign   either.   Under   such   circumstances,  
you   may   want   to   consider   a   review   or   even   change   of   fund.   
Your   ability   to   analyse   a   fund   and   set   realistic   return   expectations   from   your  
investment   eventually   defines   you   as   an   MF   investor.   The   focus   over   the   next  
zerodha.com/varsity

272    
few   chapters   will   be   on   his,   i.e.   to   identify   your   personal   financial   goals,   build  
an   MF   portfolio,   and   set   yourself   a   realistic   expectation.    
The   next   chapter,   we   will   try   and   conclude   our   discussion   on   Mutual   fund  
metric   and   then   proceed   to   goals   and   portfolios.    
Stay   tuned.   
Key   takeaways   from   this   chapter   
● Benchmarks   help   you   get   a   perspective   of   performance.   
● Most   mutual   funds   benchmark   themselves   against   TRI,   which  
is   the   total   returns   index.   
● TRI   captures   the   eﬀect   of   dividends.   
● The   returns   of   the   index   largely   depend   on   the   weights  
assigned   to   each   of   the   index   constituents.   
● TRI   returns   of   Niy   50,   and   Niy   500   is   mostly   similar.   
● You   need   to   set   realistic   return   expectations   and   set   that   as   a  
benchmark.   

CHAPTER    22   
Mutual   Fund   Beta,   SD,   and   Sharpe   Ratio   
  
22.1   -   Beta   
Over   the   last   few   chapters,   we   discussed   various   attributes   of   a   mutual   fund.  
We   will   continue   the   same   in   this   chapter   and   focus   on   key   risk   measures   of   a  
mutual   fund.   Risk   measures   include   various   attributes   such   as   -   
● Beta   
● Alpha   
● Standard   Deviation   
● Sharpe   Ratio   
We   will   start   with   the   beta.   
 

One   of   the   key   attributes   of   the   mutual   fund   is   the   'beta'   of   the   fund.   The   beta  
of   a   mutual   fund   is   the   measure   of   relative   risk,   expressed   as   number;   Beta  
can   take   any   value   above   or   below   zero.   Beta   gives   us   a   perspective   of   the  
relative   risk   of   the   mutual   fund   vis   a   vis   its   benchmark.   
I'll   not   get   into   the   details   of   how   beta   is   calculated,   I've   done   that   in   the  
Future's   module.   Here   is   the   link   if   you   are   interested   to   know   the   math  
behind   - 
https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/hedging-futures/   
Section   11.5   of   this   chapter   discusses   the   beta   in   detail.   For   this   chapter,   I'll  
restrict   myself   to   the   application   of   beta   and   how   you   need   to   use   this  
number.   Have   a   look   at   the   snapshot   below   -   
 
I've   captured   this   from   Value   research;   these   attributes   belong   to   Tata  
Multicap   fund.   As   you   can   see,   the   fund   is   benchmarked   against   S&P   BSE   500  
TRI.   
I've   highlighted   the   beta   of   the   fund,   which   is   0.95.   Like   I   mentioned   earlier,  
beta   gives   us   a   measure   of   the   relative   risk   of   the   fund.   In   general,   
If   the   beta   of   a   mutual   fund   is   less   than   1,   then   the   fund   is   perceived   as   less  
risky   compared   to   its   benchmark.   For   example,   the   Tata   Multicap   fund   has   a  
zerodha.com/varsity    
274    



275    
beta   of   0.95,   hence   the   fund   is   slightly   less   risky   compared   to   its   benchmark.   I  
say    slightly    because   it's   very   close   to   1.   This   implies,    if   S&P   Sensex   500   falls  
by    1%,   then   Tata   Multicap   fund   is   expected   to   fall   by   0.95%.   
If   the   beta   was   0.6   or   0.65,   the   fund   is   less   risk   or   less   volatile   compared   to   its  
benchmark.   Why?   Because   if   S&P   Sensex   500   falls   by    1%,   then   Tata   Multicap  
fund   is   expected   to   fall   by   only   0.65%   and   not   0.95%.   
This   is   what   I   mean   by   'relative   risk';   it   gives   us   a   perspective   of   how   risky   the  
fund   is   compared   to   its   benchmark.   
Now,   if   the   beta   of   a   mutual   fund   is   equal   to   1,   then   it   means   the   fund   is   as  
risky   as   its   benchmark.   For   example,   if   the   benchmark   falls   by   1%,   the   fund   is  
expected   to   fall   by   1%.   So   both   the   benchmark   and   the   fund   are   expected   to  
have   similar   risk   profiles.   
Lastly,   if   the   beta   of   the   fund   is   higher   than   1,   it   implies   that   the   fund   is   risker  
compared   to   its   benchmark.   For   instance,   a   beta   of   1.2   suggests   that   the   fund  
is   20%   riskier   compared   to   its   benchmark.   If   the   benchmark   falls   by   1%,   the  
fund   is   expected   to   fall   by   1.2%.   
When   you   are   looking   at   the   Beta   of   a   stock   or   an   MF,   it   is   very   important   to  
recognize   the   fact   that   the   beta   is   a   measure   of   relative   risk,   it   tells   us   how  
risky   the   stock   or   MF   is   compared   to   its   benchmark.   Beta   is   not   an   indicator   of  
the   inherent   risk   of   the   stock   or   MF.   
To   put   this   in   context,   think   about   it   this   way,   Ferrari   is   faster   compared   to   a  
BMW,   this   comparison   is   like   the   beta.   We   measure   the   speed   of   car   one 
against   car   two.   But   does   this   give   you   any   indication   of   how   fast   the   Ferrari  
is?   Not   really.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
275    

276    
Likewise,   while   beta   gives   us   a   perspective   of   the   relative   riskiness   of   an  
asset,   it   does   not   give   us   the   absolute   or   the   inherent   risk   of   the   asset   itself.   
By   now,   you   must   have   a   built   your   perception   of   beta.   Let   me   ask   you   this   -   if  
a   mutual   fund   has   a   high   beta,   do   you   think   it   is   bad?   
Well,   the   good,   bad,   ugly   part   of   beta   depends   on   another   metric   called   the  
' Alpha '.   
22.2   -   Alpha   
In   the   previous   chapter,   we   briefly   discussed   alpha.   We   defined   alpha   as   the 
excess   return   of   the   fund   over   and   above   the   benchmark   returns.   Well,   that   is  
true,   but   we   need   to   make   a   few   small   changes   to   that   equation   and   include  
our   newly   introduced   friend,   beta.   To   understand   alpha,   we   need   to  
understand   the   concept   of   'Risk-free'   return.   The   risk-free   return   is   the  
maximum   return   you   can   generate   without   taking   any   risk.   By   risk   I   mean   -  
market   risk,   credit   risk,   interest   rate   risk,   and   unsystematic   risk.   
There   are   two   return   sources   which   fit   in   the   above   definition    -   (1)   The   return  
from   the   savings   bank   account   (2)   The   fixed   deposit   return.   
Of   course,   we   can   argue   that   the   banks   too   are   not   safe   and   come   with   some  
degree   of   risk.   Understandable,   but   let's   keep   that   argument   aside   for   this  
discussion   
😊
   
Or   if   you   are   a   stickler   for   definitions,   let   us   stick   to   the   treasury   bills,   issued  
by   the   Govt   of   India.   The   treasury   bills   have   an   implicit   sovereign   so   it&apos;s  
deemed   safe.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
276    

277    
 
The   T   bill   rates   as   of   today   are   roughly   about   3.75%,   and   let   us   keep   4%   for  
convenience.   
Alpha   is   defined   as   the   excess   return   of   the   mutual   fund   over   the   benchmark  
return,    on   a   risk-adjusted   basis.   
Risk-adjusted   basis   means   we   need   to   - 
● Calculate   the   diﬀerence   between   the   mutual   fund   returns   and   the  
risk-free   return 
● Calculate   the   diﬀerence   between   the   benchmark   return   and   the  
risk-free   return,   multiply   this   by   the   beta   
● Take   the   diﬀerence   between   1   and   2   
Mathematically,   
Alpha   =   (MF   Return   -   risk   free   return)   -   (Benchmark   return   -   risk   free  
return)*Beta   
zerodha.com/varsity    
277    

278    
Let&apos;s   put   this   in   context   with   an   example.   Assume   a   certain   fund   gives   you   a  
return   of   10%,   its   benchmark   returns   for   the   same   duration   is   7%.   The   beta   of  
the   fund   is   0.75.   What   do   you   think   of   the   alpha   assuming   the   risk-free   rate   is  
4%?   
Let's   apply   the   for   formula   and   check   -   
Alpha   =   (10%-4%)-(7%-4%)*0.75   
=   6%   -   2.25%   
=   3.75%   
As   you   can   see,   the   alpha   is   not   just   the   diﬀerence   between   the   fund   and   its  
benchmark,   which   if   true,   the   alpha   would   have   been   -   
10%   -   7%   
=3%   
But   rather,   the   alpha   is   3.75%.   
Now,   many   of   you   may   not   find   this   intuitive.   You   may   question   where   the  
additional   0.75%   comes   from.   
Well,   think   about   it,   the   fund   has   managed   to   generate   a   10%   return  
compared   to   the   Index's   7%   while   managing   to   stay   significantly   less   volatile  
(remember   beta   is   just   0.75).   Hence   we   are   rewarding   the   fund   for   its   good  
behaviour   or   less   volatile   behaviour.   Therefore   the   alpha   is   3.75%   as   opposed  
to   just   3%.   
Now,   imagine   the   same   fund,   with   the   same   returns,   but   the   beta   is   1.3  
instead   of   0.75.   What   do   you   think   is   the   alpha?   
zerodha.com/varsity    
278    

279    
By   now,   you   should   guess   that   since   the   beta   is   high,   the   fund   gets   penalised  
for   its   erratic   behaviour.   Therefore   the   alpha   should   be   lower.   
Let   us   see   if   the   numbers   agree   to   this   thought.   
Alpha   =   (10%-4%)-(7%-4%)*1.3   
=   6%   -   3.9%   
=   2.1%   
See   that?   While   the   returns   remain   the   same,   thanks   to   beta,   the   alpha   is  
significantly   lesser   on   a   risk-adjusted   basis.   
To   conclude,   alpha   is   the   excess   return   of   the   fund   over   above   the   benchmark  
returns.   Alpha   is   risk-adjusted.   The   fund   is   rewarded   if   the   returns   are  
generated   by   keeping   a   low-risk   profile   and   penalized   for   being   volatile.   
By   now,   you   must   have   realized   that   volatility   plays   an   important   role   in  
measuring   mutual   funds   performance.   Beta   is   a   measure   of   volatility;   it   tells  
us   how   risky   the   fund   is   when   compared   to   its   benchmark.   Beta   is   a   relative  
risk   and   does   not   reveal   the   fund's   inherent   risk.   
The   inherent   risk   of   a   fund   is   revealed   by   the   'Standard   Deviation'   of   the   fund.   
22.3   -   Standard   Deviation   (SD)   
I've   explained   the   concept   of   'Standard   Deviation'   in   details   here   -  
https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/understanding-volatility-part-1/   
I'd   suggest   you   go   through   that   entire   chapter   to   understand   the   concept   of  
standard   deviation   and   volatility.   This   will   help   you   not   just   in   your   MF  
investments,   but   also   investments   in   stocks.   

I'll   take   the   liberty   of   skipping   the   explanation   of   standard   Deviation   since   it&apos;s  
already   explained.   However,   if   you   are   in   no   mood   to   read   an   entire   chapter  
to   figure   out   the   standard   Deviation,   then   here   is   your   shortcut   -   
● The   standard   deviation   of   a   stock   or   a   mutual   fund   represents   the  
riskiness   of   the   stock   or   the   mutual   fund   
● Standard   Deviation   is   a   percentage,   expressed   as   an   annualised   figure   
● Higher   the   standard   Deviation,   higher   is   the   volatility   of   the   asset.  
Higher   the   volatility,   higher   is   the   risk.   
For   example,   consider   these   two   funds   -   
 
I've   taken   the   snapshot   from   Value   research.   The   funds   under   consideration  
are   the   Axis   Small-cap   fund   and   Axis   long   term   equity.   
The   SD   of   the   small-cap   fund   is   23.95%   while   the   long   term   equity   is   19.33%,  
which   implies   that   the   small-cap   fund   is   way   riskier   compared   to   the   long  
term   equity   fund.   
To   put   this   context,   if   you   invest   Rs.10,000/-   across   funds   at   the   same   time,  
then   by   the   end   of   the   year   the   profit   or   loss   can   be   anywhere   in   this   range   -   
 
zerodha.com/varsity    
280    

281    
Loss   =   Investment   *   (1-SD)   
Gains   =   Investment   *   (1+SD)   
The   larger   the   SD,   the   larger   the   possibility   of   loss   or   gains.   
Generally   speaking,   the   SD   for   mid   and   small-cap   funds   are   higher   compared  
to   large-cap   stocks.   
Do   note,   volatility   or   Standard   Deviation   should   not   worry   you.   Markets   are  
volatile,   and   equities   are   volatile,   mutual   funds   are   volatile;   this   is   the   very  
nature   of   markets.   So   if   you   can't   fathom   watching   your   investment   see-saw  
between   gains   and   loss,   then   perhaps   you   should   reconsider   your   investment  
decision   inequities.   
But   if   you   do   invest   in   equities,   then   you   need   to   learn   to   manage   volatility.  
There   are   two   ways   to   deal   with   this   beast   called   'Volatility'   -   
● Diversify   smartly   (and   not   over   diversify)   
● Give   your   investment   time   
I   think   that   time   is   the   ultimate   antidote   against   volatility.   Give   your  
investments   time,   and   time   will   take   care   of   volatility.   All   along   with   this  
module,   I've   stressed   the   importance   of   giving   your   MF   investments   time,   and  
this   is   the   reason   why   I've   stressed   on   it.   
Anyway,   while   at   it,   check   the   Alpha   and   Beta   of   both   these   funds.   Few  
observations   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
281    

282    
● The   beta   of   both   the   funds   is   sub   1,   which   means   compared   to   their  
benchmark   they   are   relatively   less   risky.   But   how   risky   are   they  
individually?   We   can   answer   this   by   looking   at   the   SD   
● Alpha   is   a   positive   number   for   both   the   funds,   which   is   a   good   thing.  
The   Alpha   for   Axis   small-cap   fund   is   quite   impressive.   I'd   guess   this   is  
because   of   the   low   beta   factor   plus   the   low   risk-free   return   prevailing   in  
the   economy.   
I   hope   the   risk   parameters   are   starting   to   make   sense   to   you.   We   will   now   shi  
focus   to   another   parameter   called   the   'Sharpe   Ratio'.   
22.4   -   Sharpe   Ratio   
Sharpe   Ratio   is   one   of   the   most   sacred   formulas   in   Finance.   It   was   invented  
by   Willam   F   Sharpe,   an   American   Economist   in   the   year   in   1966.   He   was  
awarded   the   Nobel   prize   in   1990   for   his   work   on   the   Capital   asset   pricing  
model.   
Assume,   there   are   two   large-cap   funds   -Fund   A   and   Fund   B.   Here   is   how   they  
have   performed   in   terms   of   returns   -   
Fund   A   -   14%   
Fund   B   -   16%   
Which   of   the   two   funds   are   better?   Well,   Fund   B   has   a   higher   return,   so  
without   a   doubt,   Fund   B   is   a   better   fund.   
Now,   consider   the   following   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
282    

283    
 
Rf   is   the   risk-free   return.   Along   with   the   fund's   return,   I've   also   stated   the  
standard   deviation/volatility/risk   of   the   two   funds.   Now,   which   of   the   two  
funds   do   you   think   is   better?   
I   guess   it   gets   a   little   complex   to   figure   out   which   these   two   funds   are   better  
given   that   we   have   to   evaluate   them   on   two   parameters,   i.e.   both   the   risk   and  
return.   
Ignoring   the   risk,   purely   on   a   return   basis,   Fund   B   is   better.   Ignoring   the  
return,   purely   on   a   risk   basis,   Fund   A   is   better.   But   in   reality,   you   cannot  
isolate   risk   and   reward;   you   need   to   factor   in   both   these   and   figure   out   which  
of   these   two   are   better.   
The   Sharpe   Ratio   helps   us   here.   It   bundles   the   concept   of   risk,   reward,   and  
the   risk-free   rate   and   gives   us   a   perspective.   
Sharpe   ratio   =   [Fund   Return   -   Risk-Free   Return]/Standard   Deviation   of  
the   fund   
Let&apos;s   apply   the   math   for   Fund   A   -   
=   [14%   -   6%]   /   28%   
=   8%/28%   
=   0.29   
zerodha.com/varsity    
283    

284    
The   number   tells   us   that   the   fund   generates   0.29   units   of   return   (over   and  
above   the   risk-free   return)   for   every   unit   of   risk   undertaken.   Naturally,   by   this  
measure,   the   higher   the   Sharpe   ratio,   the   better   it   is   as   we   all   want   higher  
returns   for   every   unit   of   risk   undertaken.   
Lets   see   how   this   turns   out   for   Fund   B   -   
=   [16%   -   6%   ]   /   34%   
=   10%   /   34%   
=   0.29   
So   it   turns   out   that   both   the   funds   are   similar   in   terms   of   their   risk   and   reward  
perspective.   And   there   is   no   advantage   of   choosing   Fund   A   over   Fund   B.   
Now,   instead   of   34%   standard   deviation,   assume   Fund   B's   standard   Deviation  
is   18%.   
[16%   -   6%   ]   /   18%   
=   10%   /   18%   
=   0.56   
In   this   case,   Fund   B   is   a   better   choice   because   Fund   B   generates   more   return  
for   every   unit   of   risk   undertaken.   
Do   note,   Sharpe   ratio   considers   only   price   based   risk.   It   does   not   consider  
credit   or   interest   rate   risk.   Hence,   there   is   no   point   looking   at   the   Sharpe   ratio  
for   debt   funds.   

In   the   next   chapter,   I'll   discuss   the   Sortino's   ratio   and   the   Capture   ratios   and  
conclude   our   discussion   on   Mutual   Fund   risk   parameters   and   then   shi   focus  
on   building   Mutual   Fund   portfolios.   
And   I   promise   I'll   put   up   the   next   chapter   quickly

Key   takeaways   from   this   chapter   
● Beta   measures   the   relative   risk   of   the   fund   compared   to   its  
benchmark   
● Higher   the   beta,   higher   is   the   relative   risk   
● Beta   is   not   an   indicator   of   the   inherent   risk   of   the   fund   
● Alpha   is   the   excess   return   over   and   above   the   benchmark  
return   on   a   risk-adjusted   basis   
● Higher   the   beta,   lower   is   the   alpha   and   vice   versa   
● The   standard   Deviation   measures   the   riskiness   of   the   fund.  
Higher   the   SD,   higher   is   the   volatility   of   the   fund   
● Share   ratio   measures   the   unit   of   return   earned   for   every   unit  
of   risk   undertaken   
● Higher   the   Sharpe   ratio,   better   is   the   fund.   

CHAPTER    23   
                Sortino   and   the   Capture   Ratios   
 
23.1   -   The   Sortino's   Ratio   
In   this   chapter,   we   will   discuss   two   other   ratios   related   to   the   mutual   fund  
performance/risk   measures,   i.e.   the   Sortino   Ratio   and   the   Capture   Ratios.  
These   are   fairly   easy   to   understand,   so   we   will   try   to   keep   this   chapter   as   a  
short   note.   
We   discussed   the   Sharpe   Ratio   in   the   previous   chapter.   The   formula,   if   you 
remember   looks   like   this   -   
Sharpe   ratio   =   [Fund   Return   -   Risk-Free   Return]/Standard   deviation   of   the  
fund   
I   want   you   to   think   about   the   denominator.   The   denominator   has   'Standard  
Deviation',   which,   as   you   know,   is   an   assessment   of   risk. 
What   sort   of   risk?   
Well,   we   are   talking   about   the   risk   of   the   returns   varying   from   the   average  
expected   returns.   Read   that   line   again;   we   are   defining   risk   as   to   the   variation  
(or   the   variance)   from   the   average   expected   returns.   The   variance   can   be   both  
positive   or   negative.   
Let   me   explain,   have   a   look   at   the   image   below   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
286    



287    
 
This   is   the   sample   daily   NAV   data   for   a   Mutual   fund.   I've   calculated   the   daily  
return   for   the   fund   for   the   time   series,   and   I've   also   calculated   the   average  
daily   return   for   the   time   series.   
The   average   return   is   0.108%.   
Further,   I   calculate   the   excess   return   by   subtracting   the   average   return   from  
the   actual   return.   For   example,   the   daily   return   for   4th   August   2020   was  
1.23%,   the   average   return   is   0.108%.   
Hence,   Excess   Return   -   
=   1.23%   -   0.108%   
=   1.13%.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
287    

288    
Of   course,   you   square   this   return   to   get   the   variance,   from   which   you   further  
calculate   the   standard   deviation   or   the   risk.   
The   point   that   I   want   to   make   here   is   that   when   you   take   the   excess   return,  
you   get   both   positive   and   negative   values.   A   positive   value   indicates   a   profit  
and   negative   value   indicates   a   loss.   
Now,   let   us   look   at   the   Sharpe   ratio   again   -   
Sharpe   ratio   =   [Fund   Return   -   Risk-Free   Return]/Standard   deviation   of   the  
fund   
By,   using   the   'standard   deviation'   in   the   denominator,   we   try   to   adjust   the  
returns   per   unit   of   risk.   However,   the   risk   contains   both   positive   and   negative  
returns.   
Aer   all,   we   do   not   want   to   penalize   the   fund   for   a   positive   return;   we   need   to  
scrutinize   it   for   only   the   negative   returns.   
The   Sortino's   ratio   helps   in   this   regard.   
The   Sortino's   ratio   is   an   improvisation   over   the   Sharpe   Ratio,   wherein   the  
denominator   has   only   the   negative   returns   or   the   'downside   risk',   is  
considered.   
Hence,   the   Sortino's   Ratio   is   -   
=   [Fund   Return   -   Risk-Free   Return]/Downside   Risk   
The   objective   of   Sortino's   ratio   is   to   estimate   the   excess   return   adjusted   for  
only   the   downside   risk.   Like   the   Sharpe   ratio,   higher   the   Sortino's   ratio,   better  
it   is.   

Apart   from   this   one   change,   there   is   not   much   diﬀerence   between   the   Sharpe  
and   Sortino's   Ratio.   
23.2   -   Capture   Ratios   
I   find   the   capture   ratios   very   interesting.   In   my   opinion,   the   capture   ratios  
overshadow   all   other   metrics   and   get   straight   to   the   point.   
Before   I   discuss   these   capture   ratios,   let   me   tell   you   a   quick   story   from   my  
college   days.   
We   were   a   group   of   friends   in   the   first   year   of   Engineering;   we   were   young,  
restless,   and   misguided   in   life.   
😊
   
We   were   about   8-10   of   us,   always   moved   around   in   a   group.   Played   cricket   all  
day   long,   missed   classroom   sessions,   and   would   sit   in   the   parking   lot  
spending   hours   talking   about   useless   things   in   life.   I   must   agree;   it   was   a   lot   of  
fun   
😊
.   
So   much   fun   that   we   at   times   ignored   exams   around   the   corner,   to   the   extent  
that   most   of   us   would   barely   manage   to   get   a   passing   mark.   
But   there   was   this   one   guy   in   the   group   who   was   a   little   diﬀerent.   He   would  
spend   time   with   the   rest   of   the   gang,   hang   out,   chit   chat,   play   cricket,   and   go  
back   home   late.   He   would   have   all   the   fun   the   entire   group   had.   However,  
around   exam   time,   he   would   go   back   home   to   study   and   managed   to   do  
better   than   the   rest   of   the   group.    Not   that   he   scored   great   marks,   but   he  
certainly   did   better   than   the   rest   of   us.   

 
And   we   would   all   wonder   how   this   guy   did   it.   Sounds   typical   right?   I'm   sure  
many   of   you   reading   this   may   have   come   across   similar   situations   in   your  
college   life.   
But   why   am   I   telling   you   this   story?   Well,   there   is   a   reason   for   it.   
Please   think   about   this   smart   friend   of   mine.   While   he   had   100%   of   the   fun  
with   the   group,   he   knew   when   to   cut   the   slack.   He   knew   it   was   too   risky   to   not  
study   for   the   exams.   
It   may   sound   weird,   but   let's   extend   this   to   mutual   funds.   Imagine   this   friend  
of   mine   as   a   mutual   fund   and   the   rest   of   us   as   the   mutual   fund's   benchmark.   
When   the   group   (or   the   benchmark)   was   having   fun   (or   let's   say   generating  
positive   returns),   so   did   this   friend   of   mine(the   mutual   fund)   to   his   full  
capacity.   
When   it   was   time   to   study,   the   group   (benchmark)   suﬀered   (think   of   it   as   a  
negative   return),   but   this   friend   had   good   risk   management   practise,   he  
scored   better   than   the   group.   
zerodha.com/varsity

291    
If   we   were   to   summarize   his   performance,   he   had   max   fun,   but   managed   risk  
well,   and   fared   slightly   better   than   the   rest.   
The   summary   is   nothing   but   the   'Capture   Ratio'.   
The   capture   ratio   tells   us,   for   a   given   period,   to   what   extent   did   the   fund  
capture   the   positive   returns   of   its   benchmark   and   also   to   what   extent   it  
captured   the   negative   returns   from   the   benchmark.   
Here   is   an   example   -   
 
This   is   the   capture   ratio   of   HDFC   Top   100,   Direct,   Growth   fund   on   a   3-year  
basis.   I've   taken   this   from   Morningstar   India   website.   
The   fund   has   an   upside   capture   ratio   of   99,   which   implies   that   the   fund   has  
managed   to   capture   99%   of   the   Index's   up   move.   
Likewise,   the   downside   capture   ratio   is   119,   which   means   that   the   fund   has  
captured   119%   of   the   downside   returns   of   the   Index.   
The   math   behind   capture   ratio   is   elementary,   but   I'll   skip   that   since   as   an  
investor,   you'd   not   need   it.   
All   I   want   you   to   remember   is   that   the   upside   capture   ratio   conveys   the   extent  
to   which   the   fund   captures   all   the   positive   returns   of   its   benchmark.   The  
downside   capture   ratio   indicates   the   extent   to   which   the   fund   captures   (or  
rather   avoided)   the   negative   returns   of   its   benchmark.   
zerodha.com/varsity

292    
Given   this,   ask   yourself,   what   should   be   the   ideal   capture   ratio   of   a   mutual  
fund?   Well,   we   would   want   the   fund   which   captures   100%   of   the   upside   if   not  
more.   At   the   same   time,   we   would   want   the   downside   capture   ratio   to   be   as  
low   as   possible.   
Well,   this   is   not   easy   
😊
   
A   fund   will   either   have   a   great   upside   or   a   great   downside   capture   ratio,   but  
not   both.   
A   fund   either   has   a   great   upside   capture   ratio   along   with   a   disappointing  
downside   capture   (like   this   HDFC   fund)   or   you   will   find   the   other   way   round,  
where   the   upside   capture   is   low   and   so   is   the   downside   capture.   
Check   this   -   
 
This   is   the   capture   ratio   for   the   Parag   Parikh   Long   term   equity   fund   on   a  
3-year   basis.   While   the   upside   is   not   impressive   at   all,   the   downside   capture  
ratio   is   quite   impressive.   
So   the   point   is   that   it   is   always   a   trade-oﬀ.   You,   as   an   investor,   need   to   be  
clear   on   this   -   do   you   want   the   fund   to   be   aggressive   in   chasing   returns   or   do  
you   want   the   fund   to   have   a   great   risk   management   practice?   
I   prefer   to   look   at   the   latter.   I   like   funds   which   manage   the   risk   better,   and   I  
evaluate   this   by   looking   at   the   consistency   of   the   downside   capture   ratio,  
over   many   years.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
292    

293    
If   you   look   at   HDFC   Top   100,   Regular   Growth   fund,   the   downside   capture   ratio  
of   3,   5,   and   10   years   are   120,   119,   and   111   respectively.   I   like   the   consistency  
in   risk   management   here,   and   I'd   value   this   far   higher   than   the   upside   capture  
ratio.   
By   the   way,   the   3,   5,   and   10   year   upside   capture   ratio   is   98,   103,   104   for   the  
same   fund,   which   is   not   bad   at   all.   Also,   it   does   not   matter   if   you   choose   to  
analyse   the   upside   or   downside   capture   ratio;   what   matters   is   the  
consistency.   Hence   it's   important   to   look   at   capture   ratios   across   multiple  
years.   
I   usually   check   the   capture   ratios   on   the   Morningstar   India   website.   I'm   not  
sure   if   these   ratios   are   listed   anywhere   else.   
And   with   this   and   everything   else   we   have   discussed   in   the   previous   chapter,   I  
hope   you've   got   a   sense   of   all   the   diﬀerent   mutual   fund   metrics.   
The   next   few   chapters   will   focus   on   analyzing   a   mutual   fund   and   building   a  
mutual   fund   portfolio   for   specific   financial   goals.   
Stay   tuned.   
Key   takeaways   from   this   chapter   
● Sharpe   ratio   measures   the   return   per   unit   of   risk   by  
considering   both   the   positive   and   negative   returns   
● Sortino's   modifies   the   Sharpe   ratio   and   includes   just   the  
downside   risk   

CHAPTER    24   
How   to   analyse   an   Equity    Mutual    Fund   
 
24.1   -   Recap   
I'd   like   you   to   take   a   moment   and   reflect   upon   the   last   23   chapters   in   this  
module.   I   want   you   to   recap   the   things   we   have   discussed   so   far   mentally.   
In   a   nutshell,   here   is   what   we   have   discussed   -   
○ Identified   that   investment   is   a   key   part   of   personal   finance   
○ Identified   various   assets   which   can   help   us   move   closer   to   our  
retirement   goals   or   any   other   financial   goals   
○ Figured   that   Mutual   funds   are   the   primary   financial   instrument  
which   will   help   us   plan   our   financial   goals   better   
○ Aer   establishing   the   above,   we   figured   that   it   is   important   to  
focus   and   learn   more   about   mutual   funds   
○ We   started   by   understanding   what   a   mutual   fund   is   followed   by  
the   importance   of   the   mutual   fact   sheet   
○ We   identified   the   most   popular   categories   of   mutual   funds   and  
discussed   the   same   
○ In   the   process,   we   explored   various   types   of   funds   across   both  
equity   and   debt   categories   
○ Discussed   the   Index   fund   
zerodha.com/varsity    
295    



296    
○ Most   recently,   we   discussed   the   various   performance   and   risk  
attributes   of   mutual   funds.   
We   are   now   at   an   interesting   junction   as   we   steer   our   way   to   the   final   leg   of  
this   module,   i.e.   to   figure   ways   to   build   mutual   fund   portfolios   to   help   us  
achieve   various   financial   goals   in   our   lives.   
If   you   think   about   it,   building   a   mutual   fund   portfolio   has   three   parts   to   it   -   
1. Identify   a   financial   goal   (it   can   be   any)   and   translate   that  
financial   goal   in   terms   of   time   and   corpus.   For   example   here   is   a  
financial   goal   -   40   lakh   (in   today's   terms)   for   my   10-year-old   kid's  
Post-graduation   degree   in   the   US.    If   you   break   this   down,   it  
translates   to   a   requirement   of   Rs.40L   (adjusted   to   inflation)   in   15  
years   
2. Identification   of   funds   to   help   you   achieve   the   financial   goal   
3. Periodic   review   and   maintenance   of   the   portfolio.   
In   my   view,   the   first   and   third   point   is   fairly   easy.   It's   the   2nd   point,   i.e.   the  
actual   act   of   building   a   portfolio   is   the   tricky   bit.   If   you   isolate   just   the   2nd  
point,   then   you   will   realize   that   it   is   made   up   three   things   -   
○ Analyze   funds,   pick   the   right   ones   and   avoid   investing   in   the   bad  
ones   
○ Figure   the   portfolio   composition   -   just   equity,   just   debt,   a   mix   of  
equity   and   debt   etc.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
296    

297    
○ Once   the   portfolio   is   identified,   figure   how   much   to   invest   across  
each   of   these   funds 
Again,   in   my   view,   one   of   the   key   elements   is   the   fund   analysis.   You   need   to  
get   this   right   and   ensure   that   you   have   partnered   with   the   right   fund   house  
and   the   right   fund   to   help   you   achieve   the   financial   goal   you've   set   aside.   
In   this   chapter,   we   will   discuss   a   simple   technique   using   which   you   can  
analyze   an   equity   mutual   fund.   Think   of   this   as   a   template;   you   can   apply   the  
same   to   all   equity   funds.   Of   course,   there   is   no   right   or   wrong   technique;   what  
I   discuss   below   is   from   my   own   experience.    You   can   develop   your   template   as  
you   gain   more   experience   with   mutual   fund   investing.   
So   let   us   get   started.   
24.2   -   Hygiene   check   
 
zerodha.com/varsity

298    
I'll   pick   an   Equity   mutual   fund   and   set   out   the   process   to   analyze   the   fund.   As  
I   mentioned,   there   is   no   guided   path   to   analyze   a   mutual   fund.   You   need   to  
develop   your   method   to   do   that.   While   few   investors   like   to   focus   heavily   on  
the   fund   manager   and   the   quality   of   stocks   the   fund   manager   has   picked,  
others   like   to   look   at   only   the   historical   returns.   
I   like   to   keep   the   process   simple   and   stick   to   things   that   I'm   most   concerned  
about,   i.e.   the   fund's   ability   to   manage   risk   and   generate   returns.   
Alright,   so   let   us   get   started   on   fund   analysis.   
For   the   sake   of   this   discussion,   I've   picked   the   Kotak   Standard   Multi-Cap   Fund  
(Growth,   Regular).   Do   not   treat   this   as   a   recommendation   of   any   sort   
😊
   
Remember,   direct   funds   are   relatively   new   and   may   not   have   the   necessary  
historical   information;   hence   we   are   looking   at   the   regular   funds.   
The   first   step   is   to   run   a   few   basic   hygiene   checks,   which   includes   some   of   the  
good   to   know   information   about   the   fund.   Usually,   this   information   is  
available   in   the   fund's   fact   sheet.   The   first   thing   to   note   is   'about   the   fund  
itself',   take   a   look   at   the   snapshot   below   -   
 
zerodha.com/varsity    
298    

299    
From   the   note   above,   I   develop   an   orientation   for   this   fund   -   
○ It's   a   multi-cap   fund,   which   means   the   fund   can   invest   across 
various   categorizations.   
○ Since   it's   a   multi-cap   fund,   I'd   expect   the   fund   benchmark   itself  
against   a   diversified   index,   which   means   Niy   50   TRI   may   not   be  
its   benchmark   
○ I   look   at   the   fund's   inception   date,   in   this   case,   its   11th   Sept   2009,  
so   not   a   very   old   fund,   but   old   enough   to   give   me   ten   years   of  
history.   
○ The   fund   manager   has   remained   the   same,   which   is   fine.   If   you  
belong   to   the   fund   manager   cult,   then   you   can   dig   deeper   into  
who   the   fund   manager   is,   his   background,   credentials,   track  
record   etc.   I   prefer   to   skip   that   bit.   
I   dig   further   in   the   fact   sheet   and   get   other   important   information   about   the  
fund   -   
zerodha.com/varsity

 
You   can   read   through   the   investment   objective,   you   will   get   valuable   insights  
from   this   at   times,   especially   when   looking   at   debt   funds.   You   will   figure   that  
this   fund   is   not   restricted   to   any   particular   market   capitalization.   The  
investment   style   grid   suggests   that   the   fund   can   invest   across   the   market   and  
has   a   blended   approach   to   growth   and   value   style   investing.   
If   you   dig   up   the   portfolio   details,   you   will   figure   that   the   fund   has   the  
majority   of   its   investment   in   large   and   mid-cap   stocks.   Given   this,   the  
benchmark   for   this   fund   is   Niy   200   Total   Return   Index,   which   is   fine.   
I   know   many   MF   investors   dig   into   the   portfolio   details   and   start   to   sweat   over  
why   the   fund   manager   has   invested   'x'   amount   in   Stock   A   versus   'y'   amount   in  
stock   B,   and   in   the   process,   think   they   carry   out   'a   through'   mutual   fund  
research.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
300    

301    
Nitpicking   on   the    Equity    fund's   portfolio   is   not   research.   I   mean,   think   about  
it,   if   you   could   figure   out   which   is   a   good   stock   and   which   is   not,   then   you  
may   as   well   invest   in   the   stock   directly   right?   
This   is   as   good   as   sitting   on   your   couch   with   a   tub   of   popcorn   and   passing  
serious,   opinionated   comments   on   how   Virat   Kohli   should   bat   in   International  
cricket.   
Anyway,   the   fund   has   an   AUM   of   Rs.29,500   Cr,   which   makes   it   a   large   fund.  
From   the   AMC   perspective,   how   large   is   this   fund?   To   figure   that   out,   you   need  
to   look   at   AMC&apos;s   overall   AUM.   
 
The   AUM   information   is   updated   on   the   AMC   website   regularly.   As   you   can  
see,   Kotak   AMC   has   an   AUM   of   1.5L   Crore,   which   makes   the   standard   equity  
fund   about   18%   of   the   overall   AUM.   
However,   suppose   you   look   at   the   Equity   category.   In   that   case,   the   AUM   is  
about   40,000   Crore,   which   means   the   Kotak   Standard   Equity   Fund   is   nearly  
72%   of   the   category   AUM,   which   implies   that   this   is   one   of   their   flagship   funds  
for   the   category.   

Why   are   we   digging   into   this   information?   Well,   we   need   to   know   how   the  
fund   is   positioned   within   the   AMC   to   get   a   perspective.   It   is   also   expected   that  
the   AMC   would   be   extra   cautious   not   to   mess   up   their   flagship   funds.   
While   at   it,   do   you   think   funds   with   large   AUM   is   a   problem?.   I   know   many  
folks   fret   about   the   'large   AUM'   problem,   the   rationale   being   that   the   fund  
manager   may   find   it   diﬀicult   to   manage   the   funds   as   the   opportunity   shrinks.   
If   the   fund   flow   is   steady   and   the   AUM   increases   gradually   over   time,   then,   in  
my   opinion,   it   should   be   ok.   However,   if   there   is   a   drastic   increase   in   AUM,  
maybe   because   of   aggressive   marketing   campaigns,   then   that   could   be   a  
problem   and   usually   results   in   a   slight   lag   in   the   performance.   
Smaller   funds   do   have   an   advantage   in   terms   of   nimbleness.   
Apart   from   the    AUM   size,   we   look   at   the   expense   ratio   of   the   fund,   direct   is   at  
0.73%   and   regular   is   at   1.69%.   Not   surprising   at   all   
😊
   
Since   you   are   reading   this,    I   hope   you   won't   consider   regular   funds   ever   again  
in   your   lif e   
😊
   
Moving   ahead,   I'd   like   you   to   look   at   a   few   other   metrics,   these   are   reported   in  
the   factsheet   and   also   on   3rd   party   websites   like   Morningstar   and   Value  
Research.   
The   snapshot   below   is   from   Morningstar.   

The   fund's   standard   deviation   (on   a   3-year   basis)   is   20.58%;   this   suggests   the  
fund   can   fluctuate   20.58%   up   or   down   over   a   3-year   basis.   The   standard  
deviation   of   the   category   is   21.38%.   If   you   look   at   it   from   a   risk   perspective,  
this   is   nice   since   it   indicates   that   the   fund   is   slightly   better   compared   to   the  
category.   
If   you   switch   to   the   5   and   10   years   period,   the   fund's   SD   is   18.39%   and  
17.42%,   while   the   category's   SD   is   19.12%   and   18.4%   respectively.   For   now,  
this   is   a   good   sign   as   it   hints   that   the   fund   is   good   at   managing   the   risk.   
Do   look   at   the   Sharpe   ratio   as   well.   In   this   case,   the   Sharpe   ratio   is   negative,  
which   means   either   the   risk-free   return   is   higher   compared   to   the   portfolio's  
return   or   the   portfolio's   expected   returns   are   negative.   Either   way,   this   is   not  
conclusive.   Hence   we   can   ignore   the   Sharpe   ratio.   
Check   the   Alpha   and   the   beta   of   the   fund   to   get   a   sense   of   the   fund&apos;s  
performance   compared   to   the   category.   Of   course,   you   need   to   do   this   across  
3,   5,   and   10   year   periods.   
Usually,   the   fund's   hygiene   check   ends   at   this   point.   All   that   we   do   in   this  
stage   is   to   gather   a   few   important   'good   to   know'   data   points.   

24.3   -   Rolling   returns   check   
You   must   have   heard   the   line   'past   performance   is   not   an   indicator   of   the  
future   performance',   while   this   is   true,   there   is   no   better   alternative   to   this.   By  
studying   the   past   returns   and   its   behaviour,   we   would   at   least   know   what   to  
expect.   
By   past   returns,   I   don't   mean   1,3,6   or   12   months   returns.   In   fact,   in   my 
opinion,   anything   less   than   three   years   return   is   pointless   when   it   comes   to  
Equity   returns.   Three   years   itself   is   an   ok   time   frame,   I'd   suggest   five   years   or  
higher,   but   three   years   is   a   good   start.   
We   start   by   looking   at   the   rolling   returns.   By   the   way,   I   hope   you   know   what  
rolling   returns   mean,   else   I'd   suggest    you   look   at   the   chapter    and   familiarize  
yourself   with   the   same.   
I'll   post   a   series   of   rolling   return   snapshots   sourced   from   Rupeevest   website.  
Hopefully,   soon   we   will   have   Rolling   returns   of   funds   on   Coin,   our   mutual  
fund   platform.   
Here   is   the   three-year   rolling   return   of   the   Kotak   Standard   Multi   cap   fund   -   
zerodha.com/varsity

 
As   you   can   see,   I've   got   the   3-year   rolling   return   from   Sept   2012.   The   blue   line  
is   the   fund's   three-year   rolling   return,   and   the   grey   is   the   benchmark's   rolling  
return.   
The   first   thing   that   will   catch   your   attention   is   the   spread   between   the   two  
rolling   returns.   The   blue   line   is   consistently   above   the   grey   line,   indicating  
that   the   fund   has   delivered   better   returns   compared   to   its   benchmark.   
In   the   three   years,   the   fund   has   delivered   an   average   return   of   15.2%   while  
the   benchmark   has   delivered   9.87%.   
The   moment   you   see   such   an   outperformance,   rather   than   getting   excited,  
you   need   to   pause   and   ask   yourself   -   how   is   this   fund   pulling   this   oﬀ.   Is   the  
fund   taking   in   more   risk   compared   to   its   benchmark?   
We   will   figure   that   out   soon. 
While   the   spread   between   the   fund   and   its   benchmark   was   significant   in   the  
initial   years,   it   has   shrunk   since   mid-2018.   
zerodha.com/varsity

306    
Is   the   fund   losing   its   sheen?   One   probable   reason   for   this   could   be   the   rapid  
rise   in   its   AUM.   
Apart   from   average   returns,   look   at   the   minimum   and   maximum   returns   to  
get   a   perspective   on   the   dispersion   of   returns.   
The   fund's   3-year   min   and   max   is   -5.19%   and   +31.2%,   and   the   benchmark's  
min   and   max   are   -    6.97%   and   +23.53%   respectively.   This   fund   stands  
impressive   at   this   point.   
It   is   important   to   understand   that   you   are   looking   at   the   3-year   data,   but   just  
the   3-years   data   is   not   suﬀicient   for   analyzing   an   Equity   mutual   fund,   we   need  
to   look   at   five   and   10-year   data   as   well   to   get   a   perspective.   
Here   is   the   5-year   rolling   return   of   the   fund   and   we   compare   that   to   its  
benchmark,   the   Niy   200    -   
 
Again,   on   a   5-year   basis,   the   fund's   outperformance   to   the   benchmark   is   quite  
impressive.   While   the   fund's   average   is   +16.51%,   the   benchmark   is   +10.46%.  
Note,   this   is   still   very   similar   to   the   3-year   data.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
306    

307    
The   dispersion   in   returns   when   looked   at   the   minimum   and   maximum  
returns   are   also   quite   interesting.   The   fund's   minimum   is   still   a   positive   1.18%  
while   the   benchmark   is   -2.28%.   
However,   the   spread   has   narrowed   down   towards   the   extreme   right,   similar  
to   how   it   does   for   the   3-year   rolling   return.   
Lastly,   let   us   see   how   the   fund   performs   on   a   10-year   rolling   return   basis.  
Note,   there   may   not   be   many   data   points   for   the   10   years   -   
 
The   average   10-year   rolling   return   is   12.07%   versus   the   benchmark's   7.48%,  
quite   remarkable   in   my   opinion.   While   the   fund's   minimum   is   8.59%,   the  
benchmark's   minimum   is   3.79%.   On   the   positive   returns   side,   the   fund   has  
put   up   an   impressive   14.56%   versus   the   benchmark's   9.67%.   
Based   on   the   rolling   return   data,   there   are   a   few   apparent   things   -   
● Why   is   the   spread   shrinking?   Is   the   fund   losing   its   sheen? 
● While   the   returns   are   impressive,   is   this   coming   at   the   cost   of   higher  
risk?   

The   answer   to   the   first   question   is   tricky.   There   is   no   fund   manager   change,   so  
its   unlikely   the   investment   style   has   changed.   Is   this   because   the   fund   has   a  
large   AUM?   Well,   this   is   a   tough   call   to   make,   but   my   gut   says   this   could   as  
well   be   the   reason.   
Have   a   look   at   the   trailing   returns   as   on   date   -   
 
We   can   see   the   fund   has   underperformed   the   benchmark   on   a   3-year   basis,  
while   it   is   at   par   on   a   5-year   basis,   and   on   the   10-year   basis,   it   still   has   a   slight  
outperformance.   
All   in   all,   it   gives   me   a   perspective   that   the   returns   were   great   in   the   past  
years,   but   will   that   continue   is   the   question.   However,   the   interesting   bit   that  
the   performance   has   been   better   than   its   peers   look   at   the   Equity   Multi   cap  
category   performance.   
As   far   as   the   2nd   concern   goes,   let   us   focus   on   the   risk   metrics   of   the   fund,  
perhaps   the   most   crucial   bit   of   our   analysis.   
24.4   -   Risk   -   Return   matrix   check   
I   find   the   risk-reward   matrix   published   by   Morningstar   quite   useful.   Have   a  
look   at   this   -   
zerodha.com/varsity

 
I   can   choose   to   view   this   across   the   3,   5,   and   10   years   period.   I&apos;ve   been  
selected   for   five   years.   
The   initial   bit   highlights   the   fund's   risk   versus   the   category   and   the   fund's  
return   versus   the   category.   We   know   the   returns   have   been   great,   so   no   point  
looking   at   it   again.   Risk   versus   the   category   risk   is   'below   average',   so   that's  
encouraging.   For   more   details,   I   now   look   at   the   matrix.   
The   Y-axis   of   this   matrix   is   returned,   and   the   X-axis   is   the   risk.   If   you   have   read  
Varsity's   Module   9   on   'Risk   Management',   then   this   matrix   is   already   familiar  
to   you.   If   not,   all   you   need   to   know   is   that   the   higher   you   move   on   the   Y-axis,  
higher   is   the   return,   and   the   further   you   traverse   on   the   X-axis,   higher   is   the  
risk.   
zerodha.com/varsity

Anyway,   ignore   the   blue   and   yellow   button   and   start   with   the   red   square,  
which   is   right   at   the   centre   of   the   matrix.   The   red   square   belongs   to   the  
benchmark,   and   from   its   positioning   in   the   matrix,   we   can   conclude   the  
benchmark   has   generated   a   return   of   10%   by   taking   the   risk   of   19%.   
Now,   look   at   the   yellow   button;   it   belongs   to   the   category.   We   can   see   that   the  
yellow   button   is   on   the   same   vertical   plane   as   the   red   square.   Hence   we   can  
conclude   that   the   average   category   risk   is   similar   to   that   of   the   benchmark's  
risk,   i.e.   19%.   
Unfortunately,   for   19%   risk,   the   category's   return   does   not   match   upto   its  
benchmark,   as   it   is   slightly   below   the   benchmark's   return.   
So   if   you   were   to   choose   an   investment   between   the   category   and   its  
benchmark,   it   does   not   make   sense   to   invest   in   the   category   since   for   similar  
risk,   the   benchmark   oﬀers   better   returns.   
What   about   the   fund   in   perspective?   
Well,   the   fund   has   a   better   risk-reward   ratio   compared   to   the   benchmark.   It  
seems   to   have   generated   similar   returns   like   the   benchmark   by   taking   on  
lesser   risk,   which   in   my   opinion   is   good.   
Remember,   you   are   paying   the   fund   manager   for   active   management.   Active  
management   does   not   necessarily   mean   generating   better   than   benchmark  
return.   I   think    job   is   well   done   if   the   fund   manager   can   generate   similar  
returns   like   the   benchmark   by   taking   on   lesser   risk   (at   a   lower   cost   hopefully).   
So   on   a   5-year   mark,   this   is   looking   good.   Shiing   gear   to   the   10-year   window  
-   
zerodha.com/varsity    
310    

311    
 
It   gets   a   bit   more   impressive   on   a   ten-year   basis,   while   the   category   and  
benchmark   have   a   similar   risk-return   profile   (18%   risk,   12%   return),   the   fund  
has   slightly   lesser   risk   and   higher   return   profile.   
So   at   this   point,   I   know   that   the   fund   has   exhibited   a   decent   track   record   in  
terms   of   risk   and   reward   profile.   As   the   last   step,   let   us   look   at   the   capture  
ratios.   
24.5   -   Capture   ratios   
We   discussed   the   capture   ratios   in   the   previous   chapter.   I   hope   you   are  
familiar   with   it   by   now.   Here   is   the   capture   ratio   on   a   5-year   basis   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
311    

312    
 
Look   at   the   downside   capture   ratio;   the   fund   has   managed   to   capture   90%   of  
the   fund's   downside,   which   is   good.   Again,   this   a   reflection   of   better   risk  
management   at   the   fund   house.   
The   capture   ratio   gets   better   on   a   10-year   basis   -   
 
The   fund   has   captured   almost   100%   of   the   benchmark's   return   while  
capturing   only   87%   of   the   benchmark's   downside   returns.   Contrast   this   to   the  
category.   
All   in   all,   our   quick   analysis   shows   that   Kotak   Standard   Multi-cap   fund   is  
good.   Does   that   mean   you   should   invest   in   it   right   away?   Well,   we   will   discuss  
this   next   chapter.   
Lastly,   I   want   you   to   recognize   the   fact   that   we   have   not   looked   at   fund  
'ranking'   given   out   by   agencies.   Looking   at   fund   ranking   to   make   an  
investment   decision   is   quite   useless   since   you   can   do   a   better   job   yourself.   

Key   takeaways   from   this   chapter   
● You   can   start   the   equity   mutual   fund   research   with   a  
basic   hygiene   check   to   familiarize   yourself   with   the   fund   
● Know   the   size   of   the   AUM,   its   investment   objectives,   a   bit  
about   the   fund   manager,   and   its   benchmark   
● Look   for   the   rolling   returns   of   the   fund   on   3,5   and   10-year  
basis.   
● Look   for   the   average,   minimum,   and   the   maximum  
returns   to   get   a   sense   of   the   dispersion   of   the   return   
● Compare   the   rolling   returns   with   its   benchmark   rolling  
returns   
● If   there   is   excess   return,   check   if   this   is   coming   at   the   cost  
of   additional   risk   
● Look   for   the   risk-reward   matrix   and   understand   the  
risk-reward   profile   on   5   and   10   years   basis   
● Check   the   capture   ratios   

CHAPTER    25   
How   to   analyse   a   Debt    Mutual    Fund?   
  
25.1   -   Confused   Portfolio   
In   the   previous   chapter,   we   picked   up   an   equity   fund   (Kotak   Standard   Multi  
cap   Fund)   and   looked   at   the   steps   to   analyze   an   Equity   fund.   The   idea   was   to  
highlight   the   steps   involved   in   analyzing   an   equity   mutual   fund.   Of   course,  
towards   the   end   of   the   previous   chapter,   we   also   figured   that   the   fund   was  
indeed   good,   especially   when   it   comes   to   risk   management.   
The   question   is   -   since   the   fund   is   good,   should   you   invest   in   the   fund   and  
include   it   in   your   mutual   fund   portfolio?   
While   on   the   face   of   it,   it   appears   like   a   no   brainer,   we&apos;ve   analyzed   the   fund  
across   both   risks   and   return   parameters.   The   fund   ticks   oﬀ   well   on   all   the  
good   qualities,   so   it   makes   sense   to   invest.   
However,   the   decision   to   invest   in   a   fund   (and   therefore   include   it   in   your  
portfolio)   should   not   stem   from   how   good   or   bad   the   fund   is. 
The   decision   to   invest   in   a   fund   should   come   from   the   objective   of   your  
mutual   fund   portfolio.   Remember,   the   objective   serves   a   financial   goal.   Now,  
for   example,   if   my   financial   goal   is   to   build   an   emergency   corpus,   then  
investing   in   Equity   funds   may   not   make   sense.   So   it   does   not   matter   how  
good   the   fund   is,   there   is   no   question   of   investing.   

For   many,   asking   them   not   to   invest   in   a   good   mutual   fund   may   come   across  
a   counter-intuitive   thought.   
To   put   this   in   a   layman's   context,   think   about   Dolo   650,   we   all   agree   that   it&apos;s   a  
good   paracetamol.   Now   just   because   it's   a   good   tablet,   would   you   take   it   if  
you   have   knee   pain?   
 
No   right?   It   makes   sense   to   take   a   specific   tablet   which   addresses   your   knee  
pain.   
Likewise,   an   investment   should   be   made   only   when   the   portfolio's   objective  
and   the   fund's   risk-reward   profile   matches.   In   case,   you   do   not   follow   this  
approach   of   aligning   the   two;   then   you   will   most   likely   end   up   with   a  
'confused   portfolio'.   
Over   the   next   few   chapters,   we   will   discuss   how   to   align   funds   with   portfolio  
goals,   but   before   we   do   that,   in   this   chapter   lets   discuss   how   to   analyze   a   debt  
mutual   fund.   

25.2   -   Risk   recap   
Like   in   the   previous   chapter,   in   this   chapter   we   will   pick   a   debt   mutual   fund  
and   analyze   the   fund.   But   before   we   do   that,   I'd   like   to   quickly   touch   upon   the  
major   risks   associated   with   a   debt   fund.   
Credit   risk   -    Remember   the   debt   MF   invests   its   money   in   debt   obligations.  
For   example,   company   A   wants   to   borrow   50Cr   to   fund   its   operations,   decides  
to   float   a   5-year   bond   by   paying   an   interest   of   9%.   AMC   X   decides   to   invest   in  
this   bond.   Assuming   things   go   smoothly,   the   company   gets   the   funds,   and   the  
AMC   gets   the   interest   payment.   At   the   end   of   5   years,   the   company   is  
expected   to   repay   the   principal.   
As   you   can   imagine,   this   is   fairly   standard   practice.   
The   problem   arises   if   something   goes   wrong   with   the   company   during   these  
five   years   and   the   company   is   unable   to   service   the   interest   payment   on   time.  
If   things   get   worse,   the   company   can   even   throw   their   hand   up   in   the   air   and  
say,   'sorry',   no   cash   to   repay   the   principal   or   the   interest.   
All   AMCs   running   debt   funds   carry   this   risk,   i.e.   the   risk   of   default;   this   is   called 
the   'credit   risk'.   Many   funds   in   the   past   have   taken   a   hit   due   to   such   defaults.   
Now,   there   is   a   variation   to   credit   risk.   Imagine   that   as   on   today,   everything   is  
going   good   for   company   A,   but   there   is   trouble   brewing   within   the   company  
and   the   credit   rating   agencies   identify   the   same.   The   rating   agencies  
downgrade   the   company's   creditworthiness   and   lower   the   credit   rating   from  
say   AAA   to   AA.   The   act   of   lowering   the   credit   rating   itself   is   a   risk;   this   is   called,  
'credit   rating   risk'.   
zerodha.com/varsity

317    
Interest   rate   risk   -    Bonds   prices   are   sensitive   to   interest   rate   changes,   both  
bond   prices   and   interest   rates   are   inversely   related.   We   have   discussed   this  
earlier.   A   fall   in   interest   rate   tends   to   increase   the   bond   prices   (which   means  
the   NAV   tends   to   increase)   and   increase   in   interest   rate   tends   to   decrease   the  
bond   prices,   and   therefore   the   mutual   fund's   NAV.   
The   sensitivity   of   the   bond   prices   to   the   interest   rate   risk   is   captured   by  
'modified   duration'   of   the   bond.   Higher   the   modified   duration,   higher   is   the  
risk   associated   with   the   changes   in   interest   rate.   When   a   debt   mutual   fund  
reports   the   modified   duration,   then   it   is   the   aggregate   modified   duration  
across   the   various   bonds   they   hold.   
Alright,   now   that   we   had   a   quick   refresher   on   the   risks   involved,   let   us   focus  
our   eﬀorts   towards   analyzing   a   debt   mutual   fund.   
25.3   -   Portfolio   check      
I've   mentioned   this   earlier   in   this   chapter;   I'd   like   to   say   it   again,   invest   in   a  
fund   not   because   it   is   good   or   spectacular,   invest   in   it   because   it   aligns   with  
your   portfolio   goals.   
Debt   funds   allure   many   investors   because   of   the   popular   perception   that   it   is  
low   risk.   Oen   debt   funds   get   sold   as   a   safe   haven   for   your   capital,   an  
alternative   to   the   bank's   fixed   deposit.   But   it   is   not.   
I'm   not   saying   this   to   discourage   you   from   investing   in   a   debt   fund;   I'm  
reiterating   this   to   highlight   the   fact   that   debt   funds   are   not   risk-free.   Debt  
funds   can   be   volatile   and   can   cause   a   permanent   loss   of   capital.   

Alright,   let   us   move   ahead   with   the   analysis   part.   I've   picked   Mirae   Asset  
Short   Term   fund   for   our   analysis.   The   idea   is   to   lay   down   a   template   using  
which   you   can   analyze   any   debt   fund   of   your   choice.   Much   of   the   analysis   in   a  
debt   fund   is   centred   around   the   risk   and   the   fund's   portfolio,   so   this   will   be  
very   diﬀerent   compared   to   the   equity   fund   analysis.   
The   fund   itself   is   relatively   new,   with   its   NFO   sometime   in   early   2018,   so   it  
does   not   have   many   data   points   to   track,   but   it   is   ok.   
As   the   name   of   fund   indicates,   this   is   a   short-term   fund,   meaning   the   fund   will  
invest   in   bonds   which   have   short   term   maturities   ranging   between   1   to   3  
years.   
Have   a   look   at   the   average   maturity   graph   of   the   fund,   sourced   from   the   AMC  
website   -   
 
The   average   maturity   of   the   fund   is   roughly   around   2.5   years,   which   means  
that   the   fund   is   susceptible   to   default   risk,   credit   rating   risk,   interest   rate   risk,  
and   the   'change   in   the   perception'   of   interest   rate,   risk.   

319    
Now,   in   case   any   of   these   risks   get   triggered,   then   the   fall   in   NAV   will   be   steep,  
and   the   fund   will   take   time   to   recover   from   the   losses.   The   only   way   to   deal  
with   this   is   to   ensure   you   stay   invested   in   the   fund   for   a   long   enough   period.   
How   long?   
There   are   diﬀerent   theories,   but   I   believe   that   the   minimum   time   you   need   to  
invest   in   a   debt   mutual   fund   should   be   equal   to,   at   least   the   average   maturity  
of   the   fund.   So   in   this   case,   if   I'm   investing   in   this   fund,   I'd   give   it   roughly   2.5  
to   3   years   and   not   below   that.   
Similarly,   if   I'm   looking   at   a   Gilt   fund   whose   average   maturity   is   ten   years,  
then   I'd   be   prepared   for   a   long-haul   investment   lasting   at   least   ten   years.   
The   investment   tenure   is   something   you   need   to   be   super   clear   when  
investing   in   a   debt   fund.   
While   we   did   not   pay   much   attention   to   the   portfolio   in   an   equity   portfolio,  
we   do   have   to   pay   attention   to   the   quality   of   bonds   in   a   debt   portfolio.   
Here   is   a   quick   look   at   the   portfolio   allocation   (AMC   website)   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
319    

320    
 
The   fund   has   67.31%   allocation   to   corporate   bonds,   which   means   to   the   fund  
is   highly   susceptible   to   credit   risk.   Now,   how   do   we   figure   out   that   the   debt  
fund   manager   is   managing   the   credit   risk?   Well,   we   need   to   check   for   -   
○ The   diversification   of   the   fund   
○ Exposure   to   companies   -   high   exposure   to   a   single   corporate  
entity   draws   a   red   flag   
○ Credit   rating   check   on   the   papers   held   by   the   fund.   
I   dug   into   the   portfolio   of   this   fund;   you   can   do   the   same   by   visiting   Mirae's  

sset-short-term-fund   
Here   is   the   snapshot   of   a   section   of   the   fund's   portfolio   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
320    




321    
 
The   fund   holds   about   56   papers.   Straightaway,   I   can   see   that   the   top   3  
holdings   (3%   or   more)   are   all   sovereign   papers,   so   there   is   no   concern   about  
credit   risk   on   single   large   exposure.   
We   need   to   check   the   exposure   at   an   aggregate   level.   For   example,   in   the  
snapshot   above,   I   can   see   that   the   fund   has   invested   2.44%   of   its   assets   in   a  
7%   RIL   bond   maturing   in   August   2022.   
The   fund   has   also   invested   1.64%   of   the   assets   in   8.3%   RIL   paper   maturing   in  
March   2022.   So   the   question   is   what   the   total   exposure   to   Reliance   Industries  
Limited   is?   
To   answer   the   above,   you   can   quickly   add   up   the   numbers   from   the   excel   or  
check   the   quick   info   provided   on   the   AMC's   website   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
321    

322    
 
The   fund   has   a   total   exposure   of   5.56%   to   Reliance,   5.23%   to   NHB,   and   5.12%  
to   PFC.   In   my   opinion,   these   are   slightly   concentrated   bets.   
While   56   papers   seem   good   enough,   let   us   see   how   the   fund   holds   up  
compared   to   the   category   -   
 
The   portfolio   aggregates   are   from   Value   research   online.   While   the   fund   has  
56   securities,   the   category   average   is   about   64.   The   fund   has   a   slightly   tighter  
portfolio   compared   to   its   peers,   while   the   diﬀerence   is   not   much   in   this  
particular   case,   one   should   be   concerned   if   the   diﬀerence   is   large.   For 
example,   I'd   have   been   a   bit   concerned   if   the   fund   held   45   securities   against  
an   industry   average   of   65.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
322    

323    
Moving   ahead   with   our   research,   we   now   look   at   the   quality   of   the   papers.   We  
can   develop   a   perspective   of   the   quality   of   papers   (bonds)   held   in   the  
portfolio   by   looking   at   the   rating   profile.   
From   AMC's   website   -   
 
14.41%   are   sovereign   papers,   these   papers   don't   have   credit   risk,   so   that's  
one   less   thing   to   worry.   66.3%,   which   is   the   bulk   of   the   portfolio   is   AAA.   But  
do   remember   the   ratings   tend   to   change   as   papers   are   constantly   evaluated  
for   credit   quality   by   rating   agencies.   
A1+   and   AA   is   roughly   8.5%;   this   is   understandable   as   the   debt   fund  
manager's   chase   yields   to   showcase   performance.   The   question,   however,   is  
to   figure   if   the   fund   manager   is   going   out   of   the   way   to   chase   yield.   

I've   got   this   from   Value   research   online.   The   fund   has   a   higher   exposure   to  
AAA   bonds   (66%)   compared   to   the   category   (~45%),   which   is   ok,   but   this  
comes   with   credit   risk.   The   exposure   to   Sovereign   bonds   is   less   (14.5%)  
compared   to   the   category   average   of   about   25%.   Exposure   to   AA   bonds   is   less  
compared   to   the   category,   and   the   cash   equivalent   is   higher   compared   to   the  
category.   
The   information   above   tells   me   that   the   fund   is   open   to   taking   on   slightly  
higher   credit   risk,   which   to   me   is   not   a   great   sign   considering   this   is   a   short  
duration   fund.   Think   about   it;   this   is   a   short   duration   fund,   people   invest   in  
the   fund   for   parking   funds   for   say   2-3   year   perspective   with   a   moderate   return  
expectation.   
So   what   is   the   need   to   take   on   credit   risk?   I'd   still   be   ok   with   the   credit   risk   as  
long   as   there   is   enough   diversification,   but   the   concentrated   portfolio   is   not  
very   comforting   to   me.   

Let   us   go   back   to   the   portfolio   aggregates   -   
 
The   modified   duration   of   the   fund   is   1.97,   while   the   category   is   2.34.  
Remember,   the   modified   duration   is   sensitivity   to   changes   in   interest   rate.  
The   slightly   lower   modified   duration   is   attributable   to   the   lower   average  
maturity   of   the   fund.   
The   average   maturity   of   the   fund   is   2.28,   while   the   category's   average   is   2.89.   
From   this,   we   can   deduce   that   the   fund   manager   is   ok   with   slightly   higher  
credit   risk   by   placing   concentrated   bets   while   at   the   same   time   not   so   ok   with  
interest   rate   risk.   
The   yield   to   maturity   (YTM)   of   the   fund   is   4.59   compared   to   the   category's  
5.18.   Remember,   YTM   is   the   total   returns   expected   based   on   the   assumption  
that   the   bond   is   held   to   maturity   and   the   cash   flow   from   coupons   are  
ploughed   back   into   the   bond.   
Intuition   says   that   the   higher   the   YTM,   the   better   it   is,   this   is   correct.   But   YTM  
can   also   double   up   as   an   indicator   of   risk   when   compared   to   the   category's 
YTM.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
325    

326    
For   example,   if   the   category's   YTM   is   6%   and   the   fund   is   8%,   then   it   implies  
that   the   fund   is   taking   on   additional   risk   to   chase   yield.   
Ideally,   I'd   like   to   see   the   fund's   YTM   match   the   category's   YTM,   and   I'm   even  
ok   with   slightly   lower   YTM   compared   to   the   category.   
I   want   to   look   at   the   fund's   market   risk   parameters   such   as   the   standard  
deviation,   beta,   and   alpha   to   get   a   sense   of   how   volatile   the   fund   compared  
to   its   benchmark.   Ideally,   it   would   help   if   you   looked   at   it   from   a   3-year  
prospective,   but   since   this   fund   is   new,   we   won't   get   that   information.   
Lastly,   I   did   look   at   the   AUM   of   the   fund;   this   is   roughly   650Cr.   Not   a   big   fund  
given   its   category.   When   it   comes   to   Debt   funds,   I'd   like   to   avoid   investing   in  
very   small   funds   or   very   large   funds.   In   a   situation   where   there   is   a   run   on   the  
AMC   and   the   AMC   faces   redemption   pressure,   then   a   large   debt   fund   will   have  
issues   with   debt   market   liquidity.   
On   the   other   hand,   a   small   fund   will   never   negotiate   good   rates   with   the  
issuers   and   hence   is   always   a   price   taker.   So   it&apos;s   always   good   to   avoid   both  
funds   with   either   small   or   very   large   AUMs.   
So   would   I   invest   in   this   fund?   I'd   probably   hesitate   to   do   so   for   a   couple   of  
reasons   -   
○ The   fund   has   a   concentrated   portfolio   
○ Credit   risk   is   higher   compared   to   the   category   
○ It's   a   new   fund,   and   I'm   sure   there   are   better   alternatives   in   the  
market   
○ The   fund   has   a   low   AUM,   understandable   since   it's   a   new   fund   

If   you   are   thinking   why   I've   not   looked   at   standard   stuﬀ   like   fund   ranking,  
rolling   returns,   capture   ratios,   and   other   things,   well,   that's   because   it   does  
not   matter   much   for   a   debt   fund.   
Before   we   wrap   up   this   chapters,   here   are   few   things   for   you   to   note   -   
○ Investment   in   debt   funds   is   mainly   for   capital   preservation.   Do  
not   look   at   returns   or   chase   returns   when   investing   in   a   debt   fund   
○ Please   do   not   look   at   'star   ratings',   of   a   debt   fund.   Usually,   a   debt  
fund   is   rated   high   if   the   returns   are   high.   If   a   debt   fund   has   a   high  
return,   that   means   the   fund   manager   is   taking   on   risk   to   chase  
returns.   
○ Apart   from   the   standard   debt   fund   risks,   keep   an   eye   on   the  
liquidity   risk.   We   have   discussed   the   liquidity   risk   here   -  
https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/the-debt-funds-part-4/ .   If  
both   the   fund's   AUM   and   the   number   of   securities   fall,   then   it's   a  
red   flag   and   an   indicator   of   liquidity   risk   
○ SEBI   has   now   mandated   the   funds   to   disclose   portfolio   details   on  
a   fortnightly   basis,   this   is   a   good   move.   Do   keep   an   eye   on   the  
portfolio   changes   
○ Always   diversify   across   AMCs,   for   example,   if   you   want   to   invest  
in   a   short   term   fund,   then   split   your   money   across   two   short   term  
funds   from   two   diﬀerent   AMCs   
○ It   is   best   if   you   avoid   investing   in   a   credit   risk   fund.   Credit   risk  
funds   take   on   credit   risk   to   generate   a   return.   In   my   opinion,   you  
should   not   look   at   debt   funds   for   returns.   Use   debt   funds   to  
safeguard   capital   
zerodha.com/varsity    
327    



328    
○ Debt   funds   sometimes   lend   to   two   diﬀerent   companies   but   with  
the   same   promoter.   Be   wary   of   such   funds.   
Please   pick   up   debt   funds   and   try   to   analyze   them   in   the   way   we   have   done   in  
this   chapter.   I'd   suggest   you   pick   up   a   fund   with   at   least   5-8   years   history.   
Over   the   next   few   chapters,   I'll   discuss   financial   goals   and   building   a   mutual  
fund   portfolio   to   address   the   financial   goal.   
Key   takeaways   from   this   chapter    
○ The   investment   in   a   mutual   fund   should   align   with   the  
financial   goal   
○ Debt   mutual   funds   carry   credit   risk,   interest   risk,   and  
change   in   credit   rating   risk   
○ The   minimum   time   duration   to   invest   in   a   debt   fund  
should   be   at   least   equal   to   the   average   maturity   of   the  
fund   
○ It   is   important   to   analyze   the   debt   fund's   portfolio   
○ Higher   the   exposure   to   corporate   bonds,   higher   is   the  
credit   risk   

329    
○ Sovereign   bonds   do   not   carry   credit   risk   but   do   carry  
interest   rate   risk   
○ One   should   be   concerned   about   large   exposure   to   a  
single   corporate   entity   
○ One   can   look   at   YTM   as   the   measure   of   risk   
○ It   is   best   to   debt   funds   with   large   and   small   AUMs   

CHAPTER    26   
The    Mutual    Fund   Portfolio   
  
26.1   -   Assumptions   
We   have   reached   a   stage   where   we   have   discussed   almost   everything   related  
to   Mutual   funds,   leaving   us   with   the   last   crucial   bit,   i.e.   the   mutual   fund  
portfolio   construction.   I've   spent   last   several   days   to   think   through   the   best  
possible   way   to   explain   this,   and   finally   concluded   that   this   is   a   herculean  
task   
😊
   
I'll   explain   why   in   a   bit,   but   don't   worry,   I   will   attempt   to   explain   it   
😊
   
Before   we   proceed,   I   need   to   address   a   few   assumptions   I've   made.   
When   we   talk   about   constructing   a   mutual   fund   portfolio   or   for   that   matter   an  
equity   portfolio   to   solve   for   a   financial   goal,   we   make   two   assumption   -   
○ We   are   covered   for   the   risk   
○ We   are   covered   for   emergency   
Before   a   person   can   have   a   portfolio   of   any   sort,   these   two   things   should   be  
in   place.   
Let   me   explain   what   I   mean.   
zerodha.com/varsity

331    
Cover   for   the   risk   -    An   individual   faces   many   diﬀerent   kinds   of   risk   in   his/her  
lifetime.   Risk   across   multiples   areas   of   life   -   physical   health,   mental   health,  
permanent   disabilities,   a   prolonged   state   of   joblessness,   broken  
relationships,   and   whatnot.   
 
While   it   is   impossible   to   anticipate   everything   and   get   a   cover,   an   individual  
should   get   a   cover   for   two   things   in   life   -   loss   of   life   and   hospitalization.   
Of   course,   the   cover   comes   in   the   form   of   insurance.   Term   insurance   will  
ensure   that   your   near   and   dear   ones,   your   dependents   are   not   financially  
burdened   aer   your   passing   away.   
Health   insurance   will   ensure   you   don't   spend   your   life's   earnings   to   pay   for  
hospital   bills   while   getting   treated   for   chronic   illness.   
Given   this,   you   need   to   estimate   the   extent   your   family   will   be   paid   oﬀ   if  
unfortunately,   you   pass   away.   Similarly,   you   need   to   figure   out   the   extent   of  
health   insurance   cover   you   need   to   get.   Topics   related   to   insurance   are   vast  
zerodha.com/varsity    
331    

332    
and   have   many   technicalities.   I   won't   get   into   this   at   this   point.   But   I   want   you  
to   be   aware   that   as   an   individual,   the   very   first   step   in   your   'personal   finance'  
journey   is   to   ensure   you   get   cover   for   these   two   types   of   risks.   
I   want   to   stress   that   don't   buy   insurance   products   linked   to   investment   plans.  
These   are   not   worth   it.   
Cover   for   an   emergency    -   I'm   referring   to   an   emergency   corpus   here,   an  
emergency   corpus   to   help   you   navigate   your   tough   times.   Tough   time   could 
be   a   job   loss,   or   it   could   be   as   simple   as   having   enough   money   to   replace   a  
piece   of   electronic   equipment   at   home   or   a   medical   emergency.   
I   understand   medical   emergencies   are   covered   by   health   insurance   but   don't  
take   that   for   granted.    To   give   you   an   example,   in   September   2020,   both   my  
parents   were   hit   by   Covid   19.   When   I   took   them   to   the   hospital,   the   hospital  
made   me   pay   a   certain   amount   of   money   for   admission   and   cover   the   initial  
expenses.   Of   course,   I   had   an   insurance   cover   for   both   of   them,   which   later  
came   in   handy,   but   at   that   moment,   I   needed   ready   cash   and   needed   a   fairly  
large   amount.   
Or   take   this,   for   example   -   thanks   to   Covid   19,   schools   went   online,   and   I  
suddenly   had   to   equip   the   house   with   a   printer   and   a   laptop   for   my  
10-year-old   daughter.   That   was   an   unplanned   financial   expense   but   had   to   be  
done.   
Emergencies   can   come   in   any   form   and   can   come   at   any   time.   One   has   to  
have   suﬀicient   funds,   which   is   easily   available   to   you   when   the   emergency  
strikes.   Given   this,   at   the   very   initial   stages   of   your   'personal   finance'   journey,  
I'd   advise   you   to   build   this   emergency   corpus.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
332    

333    
The   question   is,   how   much   money   is   good   enough   for   the   emergency   corpus?  
Diﬀerent   people   have   diﬀerent   opinions,   but   I   see   most   of   them   agree   to   have  
an   emergency   corpus   equivalent   to   6   months   of   expense.   For   example,   if   your  
monthly   expense   is   40K,   then   the   emergency   corpus   should   be   at   least   2.4L.   
But   I   don't   subscribe   to   the   6-month   emergency   corpus   template.   
Each   person   is   diﬀerent;   each   family   is   diﬀerent.   It   would   help   if   you   sat   with  
your   family,   went   through   diﬀerent   scenarios   and   identified   a   corpus   amount  
good   enough   to   sail   your   family   through   these   tough   times.   
Anyway,   I   will   make   these   two   assumptions   -   that   you   have   the   basic  
insurance   cover   and   have   built   an   emergency   corpus.   With   these   things   taken  
care   of,   we   will   now   understand   how   to   build   a   mutual   fund   portfolio.   
26.2   -   Financial   Goal   
Imagine   a   newly   married   couple.   Both   the   husband   and   wife   are   young,   say   in  
the   late   '20s,   and   both   are   working   professionals.    The   couple   aspires   to   buy   a  
house   of   their   own.   Their   idea   of   the   home   is   a   2BHK   apartment   downtown,  
costing   roughly   1.5Cr,   and   they   give   themselves   a   ten-year   window   to   achieve  
this   goal.   
Or   think   of   this   situation   -   A   40-year-old   working   woman   wants   to   accumulate  
money   to   upgrade   her   car   over   the   next   five   years.   The   estimated   cost   of   the  
car   is   55L.   
Or   imagine   this   situation   (last   one,   I   promise)   -   A   21-year-old   has   just   started  
working   for   an   MNC.   Wants   to   accumulate   20L   in   8   years   to   fund   his/her  
post-graduate   degree   in   the   UK.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
333    

334    
These   are   all   examples   of   a   'financial   goal'.   A   financial   goal   has   three   specific  
attributes   -   
○ The   quantum   of   funds   required   
○ The   estimated   time   over   which   these   funds   need   to   be  
accumulated   
○ The   current   age   of   the   person   
Without   these   three   attributes,   a   financial   goal   is   incomplete.   
For   instance,   a   young   working   professional   who   intends   to   accumulate  
'enough   money'   to   go   to   the   UK   for   postgraduate   studies   in   a   couple   of   years  
down   the   line,   is   not   a   reasonable   financial   goal.   
With   the   three   random   scenarios   that   I   have   quoted,   you   can   imagine   how  
diverse   each   person's   financial   aspirations   are.   No   two   families   or   humans  
will   have   the   same   requirement   (apart   from   retirement   maybe).   Financial  
goals   are   extremely   diverse   and   very   personal   to   your   situation.   
However   diverse   the   situation   is,   the   good   thing   is   that   you   eventually   have   to  
look   at   mutual   funds   to   help   you   solve   the   situation,   well,   at   least   in   most  
cases.   
Of   course,   there   are   other   financial   instruments,   but   nothing   as   versatile   as  
mutual   funds   (or   ETFs).   
Given   this,   there   are   two   ways   in   which   I   can   help   you   understand   how   to  
build   a   mutual   fund   portfolio   to   solve   for   your   financial   goals   -   

○ Consider   all   sorts   of   life   scenarios,   build   case   studies   around   it,  
and   stitch   together   a   mutual   fund   portfolio   to   solve   the   given  
scenarios.   You   can   then   look   at   these   scenarios,   identify   the   one  
closest   to   your   situation,   and   build   a   similar   portfolio   for  
yourself.   
                   or   
○ Help   you   understand   the   diﬀerent   attributes   of   funds   from   a  
portfolio   perspective   so   that   you   can   identify   what   sort   of   funds 
to   pick   given   the   situation.   
The   diﬀerence   between   the   two   approaches   is   like   this   -   assume   you   like  
savoury   dishes,   so   I   give   you   20   diﬀerent   dishes   to   try.   You   taste   each   one   of  
these   and   dishes   and   finally   figure   which   one   to   eat   fully.   
Alternatively,   I   familiarize   you   with   ten   basic   savoury   ingredients.   Once  
familiar,   you   can   use   these   ingredients   in   the   right   measure   to   quickly   prepare  
a   savoury   dish   to   satisfy   your   taste   buds.   
I   will   take   the   second   approach   to   build   a   mutual   fund   portfolio,   and   I   hope  
this   works   out   better.   

26.3   -   Mutual   Fund   cheat   sheet   
I've   prepared   this   Mutual   fund   cheat   sheet   for   you.   The   sheet   summarizes   all  
the   key   attributes   of   the   diﬀerent   mutual   funds   we   have   discussed.   Please  
click   on   the   image   to   enlarge   and   get   a   better   view.   
 
The   table   is   simple,   has   few   basic   information   -   
○ Fund   type   
○ Category   
○ The   main   constituents   of   the   fund   
○ Expected   CAGR   -   as   much   as   I   hate   it,   I've   included   this   
😊
   
○ The   minimum   holding   period   -   the   minimum   holding   period   for  
the   fund   if   you   were   to   invest   in   it.   Not   that   you   cannot   invest   in  
the   fund   and   hold   it   for   less   than   the   minimum   holding   period,   it  
is   just   that   if   you   do   so,   recovering   from   a   drawdown   could   be  
diﬀicult.   
○ Financial   Goal   -   The   kind   of   financial   goal   the   fund   can   be   used  
for,   more   on   this   later.   
○ 'Special   remark'   -   Things   you   need   to   be   aware   of.   

I'd   suggest   you   keep   this   table   handy.   This   table   will   help   you   cra   a   mutual  
fund   portfolio   for   most   of   the   financial   goals.   
Before   we   proceed   further,   we   need   to   understand   an   important   aspect   of   the  
number   of   funds   one   should   have   in   a   portfolio.   
I've   seen   investors   with   10-12   mutual   funds   in   their   portfolio   for   a   single  
financial   goal.   Usually,   their   portfolio   will   contain   3-4   large-cap   funds,  
another   3-4   mid-cap   funds,   few   random   debt   funds,   and   perhaps   a   hybrid  
fund   tucked   in.   
This   is   a   classic   example   of   a   messy,   directionless,   and   a   pointless   portfolio.   
Ideally,   you   need   to   have   non-overlapping   mutual   funds   to   avoid 
redundancy.   
Let   me   explain,   assume   you   have   the   following   three   large-cap   funds   in   your  
portfolio   -   
○ Axis   Bluechip   fund   
○ Mirae   Asset   Large   cap   fund   
○ Canara   Rob   Blue   chip   Equity.   
All   three   funds   are   good,   but   does   that   mean   all   the   three   funds   should  
belong   in   your   portfolio.    Take   a   look   at   the   top   10   holdings   across   all   the  
three   funds   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
337    

338    
 
As   you   can   see,   nearly   half   the   portfolio   across   all   these   funds   are   similar.   All  
funds   hold   HDFC   Bank   to   the   extent   of   10%.   If   you   extend   this   across   all   the  
portfolio   holdings,   I'm   sure   the   common   overlap   would   be   a   much   bigger  
number.   Given   this,   the   performance   across   these   funds   also   tend   to   be  
similar.   The   economic/market   factors   that   impact   these   funds   will   be   similar,  
and   the   volatility   will   be   similar.   
Hence,   as   an   in   investor,   if   you   buy   multiple   funds   of   the   same   type   across  
diﬀerent   AMCs,   then   you   need   to   realize   that   there   is   no   significant   advantage  
in   you   doing   so.   
Of   course,   the   only   argument   for   having   two   funds   of   the   same   type   is    AMC  
diversification,   where   you   split   your   money   across   two   diﬀerent   AMCs.   You  
can   probably   do   this   if   you   worry   that   one   of   the   AMCs   may   fold   during   the  
tenure   of   your   investment.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
338    

339    
The   better   way   to   do   this   is   to   see   if   you   can   include   funds   from   diﬀerent   AMC,  
such   as   a   large-cap   fund   from   HDFC   and   a   mid-cap   fund   from   DSP,   where   you  
diversify   across   AMCs   and   market   capitalizations.   
As   an   investor,   build   your   portfolio   so   that   the   overlap   between   funds   is  
minimum.   Eliminating   overlap   is   very   tough;   the   idea   is   to   ensure   its  
minimum.   Otherwise,   you   just   end   up   paying   just   to   get   the   same   exposure  
and   costs   can   eat   into   your   returns   significantly.   
26.4   -   Portfolio,   by   the   method   of   elimination   
Let   us   revisit   the   scenarios   we   looked   at   earlier   and   see   how   the   table   can  
cra   a   mutual   fund   portfolio.   
Case   1    -   A   newly   married   couple,   aspires   to   buy   an   apartment,   estimated   at  
1.5Cr   in   10   years.   Both   of   them   work,   hence   can   save   30K   each,   every   month.   
We   have   the   following   data   -   
1. Savings   per   month   -   30K   each   
2. Target   corpus   -   1.5Cr   
3. Time   available   -   10   Years   
4. Age   -   Young   can   aﬀord   to   take   financial   risks   in   life.   
Given   this,   let   us   try   and   arrive   at   the   portfolio   by   the   method   of   elimination.   I  
find   the   elimination   technique   quite   powerful;   if   not   for   anything,   the  
technique   helps   us   avoid   the   wrong   fund   for   the   given   financial   goal.   

Alright,   with   ten   years'   time   frame,   we   know   that   investing   in   debt   is   not  
required,   so   let   us   eliminate   the   debt   category.   
When   I   say   debt   is   not   required,   I   mean   not   required   as   the   main   investment  
fund.   Let   me   get   back   to   this   in   a   bit.   Debt   has   another   role   to   play   here.   
The   focus   is   clearly   on   Equity   as   the   category.   Within   Equity   as   a   category,   we  
have   a   list   of   schemes   available,   which   we   need   to   start   eliminating   -   
○ Large   &   Midcap   -   may   not   work,   since   most   of   these   'Large   &  
Midcap   funds'   are   mid-cap   stocks   anyway.   
○ Small-cap   funds   -   These   are   risky,   volatile.   Of   course,   ten   years   is  
a   good   enough   period   for   this   fund,   but   I'd   personally   avoid   given  
the   quantum   of   volatility   involved   in   these   funds.   
○ Multi   cap   funds   -   These   are   again   qazi   mid,   and   small-cap   stocks,  
may   as   well   stick   to   a   straight   forward   mid-cap   fund.   
○ Focused   fund   -   Concentrated   bets.   Highly   dependent   on   fund  
manager   skills.   If   the   fund's   investment   turns   out   to   be   a   mistake,  
the   realization   may   come   in   a   bit   too   late.   
○ Thematic   funds   are   sector   dependent;   if   the   call   on   sector   goes  
wrong,   the   fund   will   take   forever   to   recover.   
○ ELSS   funds   -   Useless   one   needs   to   save   on   taxes   as   well.   
○ Index   funds   -   While   this   is   a   great   option,   somehow,   a   strict  
10-year   period   may   not   do   justice   for   these   funds.   These   funds  
are   best   used   for   hyper   long-term   financial   goals   like   retirement.   
zerodha.com/varsity

Given   the   rational,   we   can   eliminate   all   the   above   funds,   which   leaves   us   with  
the   following   options   - 
○ Large-cap   fund   
○ Mid-cap   fund   
○ Value   fund   
I'd   further   eliminate   the   value   fund   due   to   the   uncertainties   involved   in  
unlocking   value   stocks.   Hence,   the   best   option   for   the   couple   is   to   invest   in   a  
large-cap   and   mid-cap   stock.   
They   both   can   choose   a   fund   each   across   both   these   categories   and   start   their  
investment   journey.   Do   recall   we   have   discussed   how   to   select   an   equity  
mutual   fund   in   the   previous   chapters.   
The   easiest   way   to   invest   the   funds   would   be   a   systematic   investment   plan  
(SIP)   in   the   selected   mutual   funds   every   month.   
So   how   do   the   numbers   stack   up   assuming   a   CAGR   of   10%?   Take   a   look   at   the  
calculation   table   below.   Note,   this   is   a   not   the   entire   table,   it   is   just   a   part   for  
you   to   get   the   idea   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
341    

342    
 
I've   assumed   a   CAGR   of   10%   for   both   large-cap   fund   and   mid-cap   fund,   of  
course,   we   can   argue   endlessly   on   how   conservative/aggressive   this   return  
percentage   is,   but   it   would   be   a   waste   of   time   for   both   of   us.   
As   you   can   see,   the   couple   accumulates   1.21Crs,   which   is   quite   close   to   the  
target   funds   over   the   10-year   window.   A   bank   loan   can   plug   in   the   deficit  
(which   is   not   much).   
Now,   here   is   another   aspect   to   consider.   What   if,   as   and   when   you   approach  
the   target   year,   the   market   starts   to   fall   and   you   lose   the   accumulated   wealth?  
This   is   a   possibility;   aer   all,   no   one   can   time   the   market.   
One   way   to   deal   with   this   is   to   start   to   shi   the   corpus   funds   to   a   debt   fund   as  
and   when   you   start   approaching   the   target   year.   For   example,   from   the   8th  
year   onwards,   they   can   withdraw   the   accumulated   funds   and   park   it   in   a   debt  
fund.   There   are   many   diﬀerent   ways   to   do   this   -   
○ Withdrawal   can   be   made   on   a   monthly/quarterly/semi-annual 
basis.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
342    

343    
○ The   funds   withdrawn,   can   go   into   an   ultra   short   term   fund   since  
we   only   hold   the   funds   for   3   years.   
The   idea   here   is   to   protect   the   corpus   from   a   sequence   risk,   where   in   the  
market   takes   a   hit   as   and   when   the   target   year   approaches.   
Of   course,   this   is   a   rather   simplified   approach,   but   I'd   like   to   keep   it   simple  
and   not   over   complicate   it.   
You   may   ask   if   this   a   'fill   it,   shut   it'   approach   with   no   intervention   during   the  
investment   tenure.   Yes,   this   is   largely   a   fill   it   and   shut   it   approach.   But   once   in  
a   way   (like   once   a   year),   one   should   track   the   fund's   performance   and   take   a  
call   on   continuity.   
Apart   from   that,   you   need   to   keep   these   two   points   in   mind   -   
○ Use   conservative   estimates   when   dealing   with   returns   in  
personal   finance.   If   in   the   end,   the   returns   turn   out   better,   then   it  
is   good   for   you.   Consider   yourself   lucky.   
○ You   need   to   understand   that   the   equity   returns   are   lumpy   and  
not   smooth   and   steady   like   a   bank   FD   returns.   You   may   have   no  
returns   for   a   long   time,   but   the   bulk   of   the   returns   will   come   in   a  
short   burst   of   times.   Unfortunately,   no   one   can   time   this   short  
burst,   hence   the   need   to   SIP   and   give   it   adequate   time.   
Let   us   look   at   another   case   and   see   how   elimination   would   help   us   build   a  
Mutual   fund   portfolio.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
343    

344    
Case   2    -   A   40-year-old   person   wants   to   save   25L   over   the   next   eight   years   for  
the   kids'   overseas   postgraduate   degree.   Monthly   savings   available   for   this  
goal   is   Rs.20,000/-   
Since   the   period   is   less   than   ten   years,   there   is   no   point   looking   at   100%  
equity   investment.   The   plan   would   largely   involve   debt,   maybe   a   small   equity  
portion.   
Ok,   to   begin   with,   let   us   keep   Equity   aside   for   now   and   look   at   the   rest   of   the  
funds.   
Hybrid   funds   like   the   Arbitrage   fund   may   be   a   decent   option,   but   something  
like   a   balanced   fund   may   not   be.   
Debt   funds   are   a   good   option   -   
○ Liquid   funds   and   overnight   funds   won't   fit   the   bill   since   we   are  
talking   about   eight-plus   years   
○ All   funds   with   Macaulay   duration   of   fewer   than   two   years   can   be  
ignored   since   these   are   relatively   shorter   maturity   funds.   
○ Money   market   funds   too   can   be   ignored   since   the   investor   can  
take   on   a   slightly   higher   degree   of   risk   
○ A   short-duration   fund   is   an   option   
○ Credit   risk   is   risky   so   that   they   can   be   avoided.   
○ Corporate   bonds   fund   is   an   option   
○ GILTS   won't   fit   the   bill   either.   
This   leaves   us   with   three   good   options   -   

○ Corporate   bond   funds.   
Investment   in   a   corporate   bond   fund   requires   a   greater   degree   of  
involvement   from   the   investor.   If   one   decides   to   invest   in   it,   then   a   regular  
review   of   the   scheme's   portfolio   is   mandatory.   If   this   is   not   possible,   then   the  
only   two   options   to   invest   in   the   short   duration   fund   and   the   arbitrage   fund.  
Probably   the   person   can   split   the   investment   equally   in   both   these   funds.   
One   thing   to   note,   just   because   the   investment   is   in   a   short   duration   fund   and  
arbitrage   fund,   it   does   not   mean   that   a   period   review   of   the   fund's   portfolio   is  
not   necessary.   Yes,   the   short   duration   fund   may   not   need   as   much   scrutiny   as  
a   corporate   bond   fund,   but   it   does   require   you   to   look   at,   at   least   once   a  
quarter.   The   arbitrage   fund   too   as   the   portfolio   contains   a   debt   portion.   
I'll   spare   you   the   maths   here,   but   if   you   assume   a   7%   CAGR,   the   target   funds  
can   be   accumulated   over   the   given   timeframe.   
Since   this   is   anyway   a   longish   tenure,   i.e.   8   years,   one   can   also   consider   a   little  
equity   exposure.   Maybe   20-25%   of   the   monthly   SIP   can   go   into   a   large-cap  
fund.   
Let   us   take   up   one   last   case   -   You've   received   a   lump   sum   amount,   say   Rs.50L  
from   the   sale   of   an   asset,   maybe   real   estate.   You   want   to   use   this   amount   and  
start   a   retirement   corpus.   However,   you   are   worried   about   the   current   state   of  
markets   and   fear   that   the   current   market   level   is   unstainable.   
zerodha.com/varsity

Retirement   is   a   hyper   long-term   financial   goal.   By   hyper   long   term,   I   mean   20  
plus   years   but   may   vary   based   on   your   current   age.   
Here   is   a   plan   assuming   you   are   not   comfortable   investing   the   lump   sum   right  
away.   
○ Invest   the   lump   sum   in   a   fund   which   oﬀers   capital   protection   (to  
the   best   possible   extent)   
○ Withdraw   chunks   of   it   every   month   and   invest   that   into   the  
designated   fund   for   retirement   
○ Continue   doing   do   so   till   you   deploy   the   entire   capital   
In   this   case,   you   can   decide   to   invest   50L   over   3/6/12   months,   based   on   your  
comfort.   
Assuming,   six   months,   then   every   month   you   will   invest   -   
5,000,000/6   
=   83.3K.   
The   question   is,   what   is   the   choice   of   funds   for   such   a   plan   of   action.   
○ We   need   a    carrier   fund ,   which   will   hold   the   capital,   provide  
adequate   capital   protection   over   the   next   six   months.   
○ The   only   funds   which   fulfil   the   purpose   of   the   carrier   funds   are   -  
the   overnight   or   liquid   fund.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
346    

347    
○ Identify   a   target   fund   for   retirement.   Recall,   retirement   is   a   hyper  
long-term   financial   goal   so   the   funds   you   pick   for   this   purpose  
should   fit   this   bill   
○ The   best   funds   for   retirement   (in   my   opinion)   are   Index   funds,  
large-cap   funds,   or   just   a   balanced   fund.   
So   the   set   up   here   would   look   like   this   -   
○ Park   the   entire   50L   in   a   liquid   fund   to   redeem   the   entire   amount 
over   six   months   
○ Redeem   83.3K   every   month   from   the   liquid   fund   over   the   next   six  
months   
○ Invest   the   funds   redeemed   funds   into   the   retirement   fund   -   say   a  
Balanced   Fund   and   a   Midcap   fund.   Or   an   Index   fund   and   a  
mid-cap   fund.   
○ If   you   are   choosing   two   funds,   the   funds   can   be   split   equally.   
Do   remember,   once   you   invest   in   these   funds,   this   is   largely   on   autopilot  
mode   with   no   frequent   intervention   required   from   your   end.   However,   you  
may   need   to   look   at   the   following   -   
○ Yearly   review   of   performance   -   ensure   your   fund   is   not   lagging   its  
peers   and   behaving   more   volatile   compared   to   the   rest   of   the  
category   
zerodha.com/varsity    
347    

348    
○ You   may   want   to   rebalance   based   on   your   risk   appetite,   wherein  
you   book   some   profits   from   the   equity   funds   and   deploy   the  
same   in   debt   funds.   
Apart   from   the   above   two,   you   are   fairly   set.   Please   don't   attempt   anything  
else,   and   let   the   market   do   what   it   is   supposed   to   do.   
I'll   stop   the   case   studies   here   since   it   is   impossible   to   cover   all   sorts   of   cases.   
But   I   hope   this   chapter   has   given   you   a   good   starting   point   for   designing   your  
mutual   fund   portfolio.   
I'd   love   to   dig   deeper   on   this   topic   of   goal-based   investing,   but   at   this   stage,  
I'm   not   sure   if   I   will   take   that   route.   If   you   do   want   me   to   do   that,   share   your  
comments   below.   
Over   the   next   2   or   3   chapters,   I'd   like   to   discuss   the   Sovereign   gold   bonds  
(SGB),   NPS,   and   perhaps   a   bit   about   asset   allocation,   and   wrap   up   this  
module.   

CHAPTER    27   
Smart-beta   Funds    
  
27.1   -   Overview   
Before   we   get   started   with   this   chapter,   I   need   to   inform   you   that   this   chapter  
(and   the   chapter   on   Index   funds)   is   not   authored   by   me   (Karthik).   These   two  
chapters   are   authored   by   Bhuvan,   a   brilliant   colleague   of   mine,   who   is   quite  
knowledgeable   on   this   topic   and   asset   management   in   general.   
In   fact,   the   next   chapter   on   asset   allocation   will   be   authored   by   another  
gentleman   (and   a   good   friend   of   mine)   from   the   industry   who   is   super  
knowledgeable   about   everything   related   to   market   finance.   
I'd   like   to   thank   these   folks   for   helping   me   with   this   module   and   sharing   their  
wisdom   with   all   of   us.   
Read   on.   
-   
In   chapter    6    &    7 ,   we   discussed   the   basics   of   a   mutual   fund   and   how   it   works.  
In   chapter    16 ,   we   specifically   talked   about   index   funds.   I   had   mentioned   that  
we   would   discuss   a   relatively   new   category   of   funds   in   the   Indian   context  
called   smart-beta   funds   and   ETFs,   but   this   got   delayed.   The   idea   with   this  
chapter   is   to   give   you   a   working   knowledge   of   these   funds.   
zerodha.com/varsity

351    
The   term   smart-beta   evokes   a   lot   of   strong   opinions   among   investment  
professionals.   Although   it   sounds   fancy,   it   largely   means   nothing   and   is  
largely   a   marketing   term.   Smart-beta   broadly   speaking   is   a   catch-all   term   for  
factor   investing   and   any   weighting   methodology   which   deviates   from  
traditional   market-cap   weighting.   If   you   remember   from   the   previous   chapter  
on   index   funds,   an   index   fund   tracks   a   market-cap-weighted   benchmark   like   a  
Niy   50,   Niy   500   etc.   
Just   as   a   refresher,   a   market-cap-weighted   index   weights   stocks   based   on  
their   market   cap   (outstanding   shares   X   current   price).   Higher   the   market   cap,  
higher   the   weight   in   the   index.   Niy   50   is   an   example.   
Similarly,   there   are   ETFs   based   on   fundamentally   weighted   indices.   For  
example,   an   index   that   weights   stocks   based   on   earnings,   a   combination   of  
fundamental   metrics   such   as   earnings,   dividends,   profitability   etc.   
27.   2   -   What   is   a   factor;   you   might   be   wondering?   
A   factor   is   a   broad,   persistent   driver   of   the   returns   of   a   stock.   Put   another   way,  
in   factor   investing,   you   target   securities   that   exhibit   a   particular   characteristic  
that   drives   their   returns.   Remember   this   definition,   and   we'll   come   back   to  
this   in   a   bit.   But   before   we   do,   it   is   also   important   to   understand   a   little   bit   of  
history   for   context.   
Factor   investing   results   from   continued   academic   research   starting   with   the  
Capital   asset   pricing   model   (CAPM),   eﬀicient   markets   hypothesis   (EMH)   etc.  
CAPM   states   that   a   single   factor,   the   market   factor   or   beta,   drives   returns,   but  
this   didn't   stick.   Factor   investing   became   mainstream   when   Eugene   Fama  
zerodha.com/varsity    
351    

352    
and   Kenneth   French   published   their   landmark   research   paper   The  
Cross-Section   of   Expected   Stock   Returns.   
In   the   paper,   Fama   and   French   added   two   more   factors   -   Value   and   size   and  
market   factor.   This   meant   that   there   were   other   drivers   of   stock   returns   than  
just   market   risk;   this   was   what   came   to   be   known   as   the   Fama   French   3-factor  
model.   In   2014   this   became   a   5-factor   model   when   two   new   factors-  
profitability   and   investment   factors   were   added.   
Apart   from   the   famous   Fama   French   factors,   other   factors   like   Momentum  
and   Low   Volatility   also   have   been   discovered.   What   do   these   factors   mean?  
Here's   a    niy   explanation   from   Robeco    of   the   most   commonly   used   factors:   
zerodha.com/varsity    
352    
Value 
The   tendency   of   inexpensive   securities,   relative   to   their  
fundamentals,   to   outperform   over   the   longer   term.   
Mome 
ntum   
The   tendency   of   securities   that   have   performed   well   in   the   recent  
past   to   continue   to   perform   well,   and   for   securities   that   have  
performed   poorly   to   continue   to   perform   poorly.   
Low 
risk   
Refers   to   the   observation   that   low-risk   securities   tend   to   earn  
higher   risk-adjusted   returns   than   high-risk   securities.   



353    
So,   investors   look   for   stocks   that   exhibit   these   traits   and   then   build   these  
factor   portfolios.   
How   have   factors   performed   in   India?   There   isn't   much   data   in   India,   and  
most   of   the   factor   or   smart   beta   indices   are   pretty   new.   But   here's   how  
momentum,   quality,   and   low   volatility   have   performed   vs   the   Niy   50   and  
500.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
353    
Qualit 
y   
The   tendency   of   securities   issued   by   sound   and   profitable  
companies   to   outperform   those   issued   by   less   sound   and   profitable  
companies,   and   the   market   as   a   whole.   
Size 
The   tendency   of   bonds   issued   by   companies   with   little   debt  
outstanding   and   small-capitalization   stocks   to   outperform   the  
market.   

 
The   charts   are   from    Shyam   who   runs    Stockviz .   
Impressive   returns   all   around.   Low   volatility,   in   particular,   has   been  
impressive   with   shallow   drawdowns.   Niy   Alpha,   a   proxy   for   momentum   has  
been   impressive   but   comes   with   sharp   drawdowns.   
Here   are   the   annual   returns   for   a   more   granular   look.   

355    
But,   it's   also   important   to   understand   why   these   factor   premiums   exist   in   the  
first   place.   There   are   broadly   3   reasons   market   practitioners   and   academics  
propose:   
Risk-based :   Factor   premiums   exist   because   investors   need   to   be  
compensated   for   the   additional   risk   they   bear.   For   example,   academic  
literature   shows   that   value   stocks,   i.e.   cheap   stocks,   tend   to   outperform  
expensive   stocks   over   the   long   run.   But   cheap   stocks   more   oen   than   not  
tend   to   be   cheaper   because   they   have   a   higher   chance   of   going   bankrupt.   Or  
in   the   case   of   an   economic   downturn,   value   stocks   will   be   the   first   ones   to   go  
out   of   business.   
Behavioural-based:    This   camp   believes   that   these   factor   premiums   exist 
because   of   behavioural   biases   among   investors.   For   example,   this   camp   says  
that   the   value   premium   exists   because   investors   chase   glamorous   growth  
stocks   and   ignore   cheap   stocks,   i.e.   your   value   stocks.   Similarly,   this   camp  
believes   that   the   momentum   eﬀect   exists   because   of   investor   under-reaction  
and   overreaction.   They   under-react   to   good   news   or   good   earnings   and   then  
over-react,   causing   a   feedback   loop   which   pushes   prices   higher.   
Structural   issues:    This   camp   says   that   factor   premiums   exist   because   of  
structural   reasons   like   illiquidity,   high   transaction   costs,   diﬀiculty   in   applying  
leverage   etc.   
Like   with   all   things,   it's   not   just   one   thing,   and   it   might   be   a   combination   of  
multiple   reasons.   Humans   are   complex   beings,   and   the   markets   are   complex  
adaptive   systems.   It   would   be   unwise   to   conclude   anything   else.   

At   this   point,   you   might   have   ignored   everything   I   just   wrote   aer   the   charts  
because   the   returns   look   so   good.   But,   not   so   fast.   In   investing   there   are   no  
free   lunches   except   for   diversification   probably.   
27.3   -   Smart-beta   funds   in   India 
Smart   beta   or   factor   funds   are   relatively   new   in   India.   The   first   smart   beta  
ETFs   were   just   launched   about   4-5   years   back.   There   are   a   few   quant   funds  
from   Reliance,   Tata,   and   DSP.   But   unlike   a   smart   beta   ETF,   the   methodologies  
of   these   funds   aren't   fully   transparent.   
Having   said   that,   these   are   just   index   returns,   and   real-life   trading  
performance   is   always   diﬀerent   due   to   costs,   slippage,   changes   in   market  
microstructure   etc.   Our   markets   have   evolved   a   lot   since   2005   from   when  
these   indices   start.   You   could   argue   that   they   have   become   a   lot   eﬀicient.   
Given   that   we   are   just   seeing   the   launch   of   the   first   few   smart-beta   funds   in  
just   the   last   few   years,   we   don't   have   a   lot   of   live   trading   data   yet.   But   here's  
how   quality,   value,   and   low   volatility   ETFs   have   performed   vs   Niybees   

This   data   is   from   2019,   and   it's   not   a   lot   to   conclude,   but   it   is   evident   that   not  
all   factors   perform   all   the   time.   
Factor   or   smart   beta   ETFs   have   a   longer   trading   record   in   the   US   and   here's  
how   some   of   the   popular   smart   ETFs   have   performed   vs   the   S&P   500.   Of  
course,   this   chart   is   subject   to   starting   point   bias   because   this   was   the   point  
from   which   continuous   trading   data   was   available   for   all   major   factor   ETFs  
but   didn't   change   the   conclusion.   
 
As   you   can   see,   factors   are   cyclical   and   can   go   a   long   time   underperforming  
simple   broad   market   index   funds.   Here's   data   in   the   Indian   context,   notice  
how   the   top   factors   keep   changing.   

Value   (IWD)   has   underperformed   the   S&P   500,   dominated   by   growth   stocks  
for   over   a   decade   now.   Mind   you;   I'm   using   these   US   examples   since   the   data  
is   readily   available   and   the   Indian   markets   aren't   the   same   as   the   US.   

Now   imagine   if   you   had   put   100%   of   your   money   in   value,   not   that   many  
would.   Now   bear   in   mind   that,   no   two   factors   ETFs   are   the   same.   Each   factor  
can   be   defined   and   implemented   in   100   diﬀerent   ways.   For   example,   as  
defined   in   Fama   and   French's   paper,   the   value   was   the   price   to   book,   but   each  
value   ETF   or   index   has   a   diﬀerent   methodology   such   as   price   to   sales,  
EBIT/TEV,   forward   earnings,   or   a   mix   of   value   metrics.   This   leads   to   a   wide  
dispersion   in   returns   among   the   same   or   similar   funds.   
27.4   -   Do   smart-beta   funds   work?   
There   are   broadly   speaking   two   views   of   thought.   On   the   sceptical   side,   many  
people   view   factors   as   backtests   and   that   they   are   a   result   of   data   mining   that 
doesn't   work   as   advertised.   Then,   there   are   a   few   who   believe   that   they   might  
have   worked   in   the   past   but   don't   anymore.   
 
On   the   other   side,   you   have   true   believers   in   factors.   Several   asset  
management   companies   manage   100s   of   billions   on   factor   strategies.  
Dimensional   Fund   Advisors   (DFA)   was   most   notable   among   them,   which   was  
zerodha.com/varsity    
359    

360    
founded   by   David   Booth   and   managed   over   $500   billion   in   assets   in   various  
factor   strategies.   David   Booth   was   a   student   of   Eugene   Fama   at   the   Chicago  
School   of   Business.   Fama   also   serves   on   the   board   of   DFA.   
I   personally   think   that   factors   do   work   overtime,   but   the   factor   premiums  
aren't   static;   they   ebb   and   flow   over   time.   You   have   to   bear   a   lot   of   pain   for  
that   premium   and   have   really   long-term   horizons   to   harvest   that   premium.   
Having   said   that   investors   also   must   be   cognizant   that   the   markets   have  
indeed   changed   and   keep   changing   over   time.   In   the   90s,   when   the   first  
factors   were   discovered,   you   could   argue   that   the   markets   still   had   many  
ineﬀiciencies   and   retail   investors   still   made   up   a   good   chunk   of   the   markets.   
Today,   everybody   has   all   the   data   at   the   click   of   a   button   on   smartphones,  
and   there   are   millions   of   CFA   holders,   hedge   funds   that   manage   trillions   of  
dollars   constantly   seeking   new   ineﬀiciencies.   Even   in   India,   mutual   funds,  
PMS',   AIFs,   HFT   traders,   institutions   have   become   dominant   players   in   the  
markets.   
Have   the   factors   been   arbitraged   away?   Unlikely,   investors   shouldn't   just   look  
at   past   returns   of   indices   and   backtests   and   have   the   same   expectations.   The  
probabilities   are   the   premiums   might   not   be   as   large   as   they   seem.   
The   proliferation   of   data   and   computing   power   has   also   led   to   100s   of   new  
factors   resulting   from   data   mining.   If   you   look   at   the   backtests   of   some   of  
these   factors,   they   look   amazing,   but   they   are   spurious   at   the   end   of   the   day.  
Practitioners   and   academics   have   termed   this   as   the    "factor   zoo" .   

27.5   -   Should   you   invest   in   smart-beta   funds? 
I   do   not   think   investing   100%   of   your   equity   allocation   in   smart-beta   funds   is  
a   good   idea.   Nor   do   I   think   that   smart-beta   funds   should   be   viewed   as  
replacements   for   index   funds   or    good    diversified   active   funds   that    perform  
consistently    -   emphasis   on   good   and   consistent.   
But   we've   seen   in   the   previous   chapter   on   index   funds   that   a   vast   majority   of  
active   funds   don't   beat   their   benchmarks.   I   do   think   smart-beta   funds   are   a  
good   replacement   for   poorly   managed   discretionary   active   funds.   The   bulk   of  
your   equity   allocation   should   be   good   consistent   diversified   active   equity  
funds   or   in   index   funds.   And   then   you   can   invest   in   smart-beta   funds   for   that  
chance   of   extra   returns.   
But   do   remember,   factors   can   go   a   long   time   underperforming   simple   index  
funds.   These   premiums   are   also   sensitive   to   the   amount   of   money   chasing  
them.   So,   as   more   such   funds   are   launched   in   India,   and   more   money   flows  
into   them,   the   factor   premiums   might   not   always   be   as   large   as   they   once  
were.   Remember,   there   are   no   free   lunches   in   the   markets,   and   every   choice  
you   make   as   an   investor   comes   with   trade-oﬀs.   You   need   to   endure   that   pain  
if   you   hope   to   harvest   those   additional   returns,   say,   a   simple   index   fund.   
One   solution   is   to   diversify   among   factors,   there   are   multi-factors   funds   that  
invest   in   multiple   factors,   but   we   don't   have   many   of   those   in   India   yet.   ICICI  
alpha   low   volatility   ETF,   which   was   recently   launched,   combines   two  
momentum   and   low   volatility.   Similarly,   DSP   Quant   Fund   and   the   likes   of   Tata  
Quant   Fund   also   are   multi-factor   funds.   But   their   methodologies   aren't   as  
transparent   as   index-based   smart   beta   ETFs.   

We   see   AMCs   slowly   launching   these   funds,   and   hopefully,   we'll   have   more  
choices   in   the   next   couple   of   years.   
Key   Takeaways   from   this   Chapter   
● The   idea   with   this   chapter   was   to   give   you   a   working  
understanding   of   smart   beta   and   factor   investing.   I   think   you  
need   to   dive   deeper   if   you   wish   to   allocate   to   these   funds.  
There   are   some   amazing   resources   on   factor   investing,   and   a  
cursory   Google   will   surface   them.   Please   dive   deeper   before  
investing   in   these   funds.   
● Smart   beta   is   just   a   marketing   term.   There   is   no   smart   beta   or  
dumb   beta.   
● Smart-beta   funds   are   nothing   but   factor   funds   or   funds   that  
have   alternatively   weighted   indices   unlike   Niy   50   which   is  
market-cap-weighted   
● The   live   performance   of   factor   funds   can   be   diﬀerent   than   the  
indices.   
● Factors   can   be   highly   cyclical,   and   individual   factors   can  
underperform   simple   diversified   funds   or   index   funds   for  
decades.   
● If   you   want   to   invest   in   factor   funds,   diversification   among  
factors   is   an   important   consideration.   

CHAPTER    28   
   Asset   Allocation,   An   Introduction   
  
Dear   Readers,    
Like   this   previous   chapter,   this   chapter   too   is   a   guest   chapter.   We   are   honoured  
to   have   this   super   important   chapter   authored   by    Shyam ,   who   runs    Stockviz .  
We   are   grateful   to   Shyam   for   sharing   his   wisdom   on   this   topic   with   us.   We   hope  
he   can   contribute   more   to   Varsity,   and   enrich   Varsity's   content   
🙂
   
Happy   reading!   

28.1   -   Asset   Allocation,   an   Introduction   
An   asset   is   anything   that   you   own.   A   liability   is   something   that   you   owe.   
An   asset   can   be   anything:   livestock,   gold,   stocks,   bonds,   collectables,   art,  
copyrights,   trademarks,   and   so   and   so   forth.   
zerodha.com/varsity

 
Some   assets   (bonds,   for   example)   throw-oﬀ   cash   (pay   interest)   when   you   own  
them,   some   (art,   for   example)   don't.   The   basic   purpose   of   owning   an   asset   is  
to   transmit   wealth   through   time.   
Time   value   of   money   
Money,   in   the   form   of   currency,   is   designed   to   depreciate   over   time.   Central  
Banks   call   this   rate   of   depreciation   their   "inflation   target."   For   example,   when  
the   US   Fed   says   that   they   are   targeting   2%   inflation,   the   purchasing   power   of  
a   $100   note   will   be   $98   next   year.   In   India,   RBI's   goal   is   to   manage   inflation  
between   4%   and   6%.   We   ended   the   year   2020   with   an   inflation   rate   of   close   to  
7%.   Clearly,   stuﬀing   money   under   a   mattress   is   a   loser's   game.   So,   how   do  
you   preserve   the   purchasing   power   of   your   wealth?   You   buy    assets ,   of   course.   
Diﬀerent   type   of   assets   
zerodha.com/varsity    
364    

365    
 
Precious   Metals   
Since   the   dawn   of   civilization,   people   have   been   trying   to   find   cost-eﬀective  
ways   to   store,   transport   and   exchange   wealth.   It   took   a   while   for   us   to   zero-in  
on   gold   and   silver   as   a   medium   of   exchange   and   a   store   of   wealth: 
● They   are   rare,   ensuring   a   limited   supply.   
● Takes   work   to   mine,   purify,   mould,   etc.   This   puts   a   floor   on   additional  
supply.   
● Easily   understood,   measured   and   assayed.   
● Suﬀiciently   dense   so   that   small   quantities   representing   large   notional  
values   can   be   moved   around   easily.   
So,   it   shouldn't   come   to   a   surprise   that   most   people   still   think   of   gold   (and  
precious   metals,   in   general)   as   a    must-have    asset.   Investors   instinctively   reach  
zerodha.com/varsity    
365    

366    
for   gold   when   other   assets   are   facing   stress.   And   for   savers   in   countries   with   a  
long   history   of   socialism   with   their   governments   trying   to   confiscate   property  
and   inflate   away   their   currencies,   gold   forms   a   large   part   of   their   savings.   
Real-estate   
Broadly,   real-estate   investing   covers   land   speculation,   rental-housing   and  
commercial   property.   They   each   have   their   unique   characteristics   and   scale  
requirements.   Each   piece   of   real-estate   is   diﬀerent   -   they   are   not   fungible,  
like   precious   metals,   nor   can   they   be   transported.   So   every   real-estate  
investor's   experience   will   be   diﬀerent.   
Collectables   
Well,   known   pieces   of   art,   baseball   cards,   stamps,   rare-coins   etc.   are   known  
to   hold   their   value   through   time.   A   mature   ecosystem   of   services   that   curate,  
authenticate,   promote   and   store   collectables   exists   to   make   investing   in   them  
relatively   painless.   
Over   the   last   decade   or   so,   we   have   seen   the   rise   of    digital    collectables,   like  
bitcoin.   They   have   the   added   benefit   of   being   infinitely   divisible.   To   use   the  
bitcoin   example,   even   though   a   single   bitcoin   is   currently   worth   north   of  
$40,000,   a   newbie   can   buy   just   $10   worth   of   it.   
Financial   Assets   
Assets   that   can   be   traded   on   an   exchange,   like   stocks,   bonds,   commodities,  
etc.   benefit   from   standardization   and   the   uniform   application   of   laws   and  
regulations.   Standardization   ensures   that   investors   always   get   what   they   paid  
zerodha.com/varsity    
366    

367    
for   and   regulations   ensure   that   the   exchange   doesn't   favour   one   investor   over  
another   while   disseminating   information,   clearing   trades,   etc.   
The   most   liquid   and   popular   of   these   assets   are   stocks/equities,   the   largest  
are   bonds/fixed-income.   Commodities   come   a   close   third.   Overlaid   on   top   of  
these   are   derivatives   -   instruments   that    derive    their   value   from   an   underlying  
stock/bond/commodity   -   that   are   now   a   bigger   market   than   the   assets  
themselves.   
Since   the   1980s,   the   number   of   diﬀerent   asset   types   traded   on   electronic  
exchanges   has   increased   by   leaps   and   bounds.   Assets   that   were   once   illiquid  
because   of   physical   delivery   requirements   or   geographical   barriers   have   seen  
an   explosion   of   liquidity   as   they   are   now   traded   through   derivatives   and   ETFs.   
28.2   -   Allocation   
The   act   of   splitting   one's   savings   between   the   diﬀerent   types   of   assets  
described   above   is   called   "asset   allocation."   
Prediction   is   impossible   
If   you   knew   which   of   the   assets   discussed   above   would   give   the   best   returns,  
then   you   could   just   put   all   your   money   in   that   single   asset.   But   unfortunately,  
no   one   knows   the   answer   to   that   question.   
For   example,   take   US   and   Indian   stocks.   For   the   decade   between   2001   and  
2011,   Indian   stocks   massively   out-performed   US   stocks.   
zerodha.com/varsity

 
But   performance   completely   inverted   in   the   next   decade.   
 

Once   prices   start   moving,   narratives   get   built   around   why   they   are   justified  
and   persist   forever.   The   longer   the   price   moves,   the   stronger   the   narratives.  
Remember   "India   shining,"   "secular   stagnation,"   "home   prices   always   go   up?"   
The   only   way   to   protect   yourself   from   decades   of   underperformance   without  
having   to   predict   is   to   buy   a   little   bit   of   all   assets.   
28.3   -   Sequence   Risk   
An   average   investor   rarely   sees   average   returns.   
Markets   have   been   around   for   centuries,   but   an   investment's   lifespan   is   not  
more   than   a   few   decades.   This   leads   to   all   sorts   of   misconceptions   regarding  
averages   and   risk   capacity.   
Investor :   On   average,   over   the   last   20   years,   the   NIFTY   has   given   a   CAGR   of  
10%.   So,   if   I   invest   Rs   1   lakh   for   5   years,   I   should   get   at   least   Rs   1.61   lakhs,   no?   
Me :   No.   Consider   yourself   lucky   if   you   don't   lose   money.   
Investor :   But   it   has   given   negative   returns   only   4   years   out   of   10.   I   can   survive  
2   years   of   negative   returns.   
Me :   Let   me   tell   you   something   about   sequence   risk.   Sequence   risk   means   that  
it   is   possible   that   you   could   have   all   of   those   negative   4   years   during   the   5  
year   period   that   you   have   invested.   

Most   investors   don't   realize   that   while   averages   may   be   true   in   the   aggregate,  
they   may   not   survive   long   enough   in   the   market   for   their   personal   experience  
to   match   up   with   the   statistics.   
A   simple   way   to   avoid   this   risk   is   to   invest   in   a   basket   of   assets   whose   returns  
are   not   correlated   to   each   other.   
28.4   -   Diversification   vs   Diworsification   
   
 
A   basket   with   chicken   eggs,   turkey   eggs,   goose   eggs,   quail   eggs,   pheasant  
eggs   and   emu   eggs   is   theoretically   diversified   but   practically   useless   when  
the   basket   is   dropped.   
To   create   a   diversified   portfolio,   you   need   first   to   understand   the   drivers  
behind   each   asset   class's   returns   and   how   they   interact   with   each   other.   
Vectors   of   diversification   
zerodha.com/varsity

371    
Diﬀerent   vectors   drive   returns   of   diﬀerent   assets   and   the   correlations  
between   them.   A   well-diversified   portfolio   covers   these   diﬀerent   vectors   with  
minimal   overlap.   Some   examples   below.   
Currency   exchange   rates   
Gold   is   priced   in   international   markets,   so   its   future   price   movements   in   India  
are   both   a   function   of   global   demand   and   USDINR   exchange   rate.   
 
Market   composition   
"old   economy"   stocks   mostly   dominate   indian   equity   markets   while   that   of  
America's   is   dominated   by   tech   ("new   economy")   stocks.   So   they   require  
separate   allocations   in   a   portfolio   even   though   they   are   "stocks."   
Flows   during   panics 

American   bonds   are   "safe-haven"   assets.   During   market   panics,   US   bonds   get  
bid   up.   However,   Indian   assets   are   clubbed   along   with   other   "emerging  
market"   assets   and   sold-oﬀ.   So,   while   having   US   bonds   in   a   portfolio   can  
cushion   it   during   sell-oﬀs,   owning   Indian   bonds   may   not   oﬀer   the   same  
benefit.   
Here's   how   the   US,   Developed   Markets   and   Emerging   Market   Bond   funds   have  
behaved   through   time.   
 
Bubble   assets   
Some   assets,   especially   digital   collectables,   are   prone   to   boom-and-bust  
cycles.   While   Bitcoin   gets   all   the   press...   

 
...   the   fact   that   CryptoKitties   raised   a   total   of   $23   million   in   venture   capital  
funding   and   people   thought   paying   money   to   collect   and   breed   virtual   cats  
on   the   blockchain   was   a   good   idea   should   give   investors   some   pause.   
 
A   similar   dynamic   exists   in   the   art   market   as   well,   where   investors   try   to   spot  
emerging   artists   and   bid   up   their   works.   

28.4   -   Keeping   it   simple   
If   you   are   starting,   you   will   do   well   to   stick   with   big,   liquid   asset   classes:   
1. Indian   Equities   
○ Large-cap   Index   
○ Mid-cap   fund   
2. US   equities   
Since   large   US   companies   have   significant   global   footprints,   the   S&P  
500   index   gives   ample   exposure   to   most   developed   worlds.   Indian  
investors   are   unlikely   to   benefit   much   from   chasing   aer   European,  
Frontier   or   other   Emerging   markets.   
3. Bonds   
4. Gold   
5. Real   estate   
If   you   are   unsure   of   the   relative   proportions   or   you   are   just   getting   started,  
then   an   equal   weight   allocation   between   them   is   not   such   a   bad   idea.   
For   US   stocks,   stick   to   the   cheapest   S&P   500   index   fund   that   you   can   find.   
For   Bonds,   find   a   short-term   bond   fund   that   invests   only   in   government   or  
PSU   bonds. 
For   Gold,   go   for   the   RBI   issued   Sovereign   Gold   Bonds   that   actually   pays   you  
2.5%   p.a.   for   owning   gold.   
For   Real   estate,   see   if   exchange-traded   REITs   make   sense.   
28.5   -Risks   to   diversification   

375    
As   more   assets   get   financialized,   building   a   diversified   portfolio   becomes  
easier   and   more   accessible.   But   financialization   also   changes   the   behaviour  
of   the   assets   themselves.   
Using   real-estate   as   an   example,   transactions   in   the   real-world   take   months  
and   involve   a   diﬀerent   set   of   actors   than   transactions   on   an   exchange-traded  
REIT   that   take   seconds.   The   low   historical   correlations   that   one   might   have  
seen   between   real-estate   and   stocks   could've   been   a   function   of   the   diﬀerent  
venues   where   they   were   transacted,   lower   liquidity,   long   transaction   times  
and   inability   to   cross-leverage.   But   once   you   put   all   these   diﬀerent   assets   on  
the   same   platform   and   allow   investors   to   lever   one   asset   to   buy   another,   you  
end   up   increasing   their   correlations.   So,   while   financialization   makes   it   easier  
to   diversify,   it   blunts   its   eﬀectiveness.   
Keynotes   from   this   chapter   
● One   cannot   avoid   buying   assets.   
● Know   the   diﬀerent   types   of   assets,   and   the   factors   drive   their  
returns.   
● Draw-up   an   asset-allocation   strategy   (KISS:   Keep   It   Simple,  
Stupid!)   
● Stick   to   the   allocation   strategy   because   prediction   is  
impossible.   
● Nothing   works   all   the   time.   The   world   around   you   changes.   Be  

 
Please   note,   this   is   a   guest   chapter,   and   I've   not   authored   this.   This   chapter   on  
ETFs   is   authored   by   my   colleague,   Bhuvan.   However,   I'll   try   and   answer   all   the  
following   queries   that   you'd   post.    

29.1   -   Overview    
In    chapter   7 ,   we   looked   at   what   a   mutual   fund   is   and   how   it   works.   To   recap,   a  
mutual   fund   is   a   pooled   investment   vehicle   that   collects   the   money   from  
various   investors,   invests   and   manages   that   money   on   their   behalf.   When   you  
invest   in   a   mutual   fund   before   the   order   placement   cut-oﬀ   time,   you   will   get  
the   units   as   per   the   same   day's   NAV   which   is   disclosed   by   midnight.   If   you  
invest   aer   the   order   placement   cut-oﬀ   time,   you'll   get   the   allotment   of   units  
per   the   next   day's   NAV.   Basically,   everything   happens   at   the   end   of   the   day.   
Now,   what   if   those   mutual   funds   units   could   be   traded   on   the   stock   exchange  
just   like   stocks   like   Reliance   or   Infosys?   Just   like   a   mutual   fund,   an  
exchange-traded   fund   (ETF)   is   a   pooled   investment   vehicle   that   holds   a  
basket   of   securities   like   stocks,   bonds,   and   commodities   and   trades   on   the  
stock   exchanges.   You   can   buy   and   sell   an   ETF   anytime,   just   like   a   stock.   

There   are   a   few   more   nuances   to   an   ETF   than   a   mutual   fund,   but   before   we  
dive   in,   I   hope   you   have   a   working   idea   of   what   an   ETF   is.   
29.2   -   History   of   ETFs   
Mutual   funds   have   been   around   in   some   form   for   well   over   100-years.   The  
first   open-ended   mutual   fund   in   the   US   was   launched   in   1924   and   is   still   in  
existence   today.   The   first   mutual   fund   in   India   was   launched   in   1964.   Mutual  
funds   have   democratized   access   to   stocks,   bonds,   real   estate   and  
commodities   globally   to   common   investors.   Exchange-traded   funds   (ETF)  
were   the   next   evolution   of   mutual   funds.   
ETFs,   on   the   other   hand,   are   relatively   new.   The   SPDR   S&P   500   trust,   arguably  
the   first   ETF,   was   launched   in   1993   in   the   US.   Coincidentally,   it   is   today   the  
largest   traded   security   in   the   world.   NiyBeES,   an   ETF   tracking   the   Niy   50  
index   was   the   first   ETF   in   India   and   was   launched   in   2000.   It   was   launched   by  
Benchmark   AMC,   which   Goldman   Sachs   later   acquired,   which   Reliance   later  
acquired,   which   Nippon   India   Mutual   Fund   later   acquired

   
29.3   -   ETFs   in   India   
Though   ETFs   have   been   around   for   a   while   in   India,   they   haven't   really   been  
popular   among   retail   investors.   ETFs   have   mostly   been   used   by   HNIs   and  
institutions.   For   example,   the   SBI   Niy   50   ETF   with   Rs   89,441.55   cr   is   the  
largest   mutual   fund   in   India.   This   is   almost   entirely   because   this   is   one   of   the  
ETFs   in   which   the   Employees'   Provident   Fund   Organisation   (EPFO)   invests.   
A   large   part   of   the   ETF   AUM   growth   is   due   to:   
zerodha.com/varsity    
377    

378    
● EPFO   investing   in   Niy   &   Sensex   ETF   
● Government   divestment   through   CPSE   ETF   and   Bharat   22   ETF   
● Introduction   and   the   Govt   push   for   Bharat   Bond   Debt   ETFs.   Most   of   the  
AUM   in   these   ETFs   is   non-retail.   
 
Growth   of   ETF   AUM   in   India   
Though   still   a   small   piece   of   the   pie,   retail   participation   has   been   growing  
steadily   over   the   years   and   so   has   the   trading   turnover   on   the   exchanges.   
NiyBeES   which   is   20   years   old,   just   has   about   Rs   2800   crores   of   AUM.   There  
are   a   lot   of   reasons   for   the   under   penetration   of   ETFs:   
1. India   is   still   a   tiny   market.   We   just   have   about   1.7   crore   active   demat  
accounts,   and   unlike   a   mutual   fund,   you   can   only   buy   an   ETF   if   you  
have   a   demat   account.   
2. Investment   products,   be   it   mutual   funds   or   ETFs   are   push   products.  
One   of   the   reasons   why   mutual   funds   are   larger   than   ETFs   is   because  
AMCs   can   pay   distributors   &   platforms   commissions   to   sell   their   mutual  
funds.   But   ETFs   don't   have   commissions   like   mutual   funds.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
378    

379    
3. ETFs   are   also   relatively   trickier   to   understand   initially   compared   to  
mutual   funds.   But   we'll   take   care   of   that   with   this   chapter.   
4. Most   AMCs   rarely   push   ETFs   because   they   have   low   margins   and   don't  
make   sense   with   small   AUMs.   
 
29.4   -   What   is   an   ETF?   
An   exchange-traded   fund   (ETF),   just   like   a   mutual   fund   is   a   basket   of  
securities,   but   this   is   where   the   similarity   with   a   mutual   fund   ends.   Unlike   a  
mutual   fund,   an   ETF   trades   throughout   the   day   on   the   stock   exchanges.   You  
can   buy   and   sell   an   ETF   anytime   you   want   just   like   a   stock.   
For   example,   if   you   search   for   "Niy   ETF"   on   Kite,   you'll   see   a   list   of   all   ETFs  
that   track   the   Niy   50   index.   

Searching   ETFs   on   Kite   
29.5   -   How   does   an   ETF   work?   
When   you   buy   a   mutual   fund,   the   AMC   takes   money   from   you   and   buys   the  
securities   and   discloses   the   NAV   at   the   end   of   the   day.   Similarly,   when   you  
redeem   your   mutual   funds,   the   AMC   sells   the   securities   and   returns   your  
money.   This   is   quite   straightforward.   However,   when   you   buy   an   ETF,   you  
don't   really   interact   with   the   AMC   most   of   the   time   because   most   buying   and  
selling   happens   on   the   stock   exchanges.   It's   just   an   exchange   of   units  
between   buyers   and   sellers.   
29.6   -   Creation   and   redemption   mechanism   
I   said   when   you   buy   an   ETF,   you   "mostly"   don't   interact   with   the   AMC   and   I'll  
explain   what   that   means.   If   you   remember    chapter   6 ,   we   discussed   all   the  
entities   involved   in   an   MF   transaction   -   the   AMC,   custodian   and   the   RTA.   But  
what   makes   an   ETF   unique   is   something   called   the   creation   and   redemption 
mechanism.   But   before   we   talk   about   it,   you   need   to   know   a   couple   of   things.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
380    



381    
1. NAV,   iNAV,   the   market   price   
2. Market   makers   and   authorized   participants   
3. Creation   units   
4. Premiums   &   discounts   
5. Tracking   error   
Market   price   
When   you   buy   a   mutual   fund,   you   look   at   the   NAV.   Similarly,   when   you   are  
buying   an   ETF,   you   look   at   the   ETF   market   price   on   Kite.   
 
ETF   prices   
These   prices   are   determined   by   the   demand,   supply   and   the   trading   activity  
on   the   exchanges.   But   how   do   you   know   if   the   price   you   see   on   Kite   is   the   fair  
price   you   are   paying   for   an   ETF?   Here's   where   the   Net   Asset   Value   (NAV)  

Like   a   mutual   fund,   an   ETF   also   has   an   end   of   the   day   Net   Asset   Value   (NAV).  
Just   to   refresh   your   memory,   NAV   tells   you   the   total   value   of   all   the   fund's  
assets   and   yours.   The   formula   for   calculating   NAV   is   NAV   =   (Value   of   all   the  
assets   -   the   expenses)/number   of   shares   (units).   But   remember,   an   ETF  
trades   real-time,   whereas   NAVs   are   only   announced   at   the   end   of   the   day.   So  
how   do   you   figure   out   if   the   price   you   are   paying   for   an   ETF   is   fair   in   real-time?  
Enter   iNAV   
Intraday   or   indicative   net   asset   value   (iNAV)   
Given   that   ETFs   trade   real-time,   you   need   a   reference   point   to   see   if   the  
market   price   you   see   on   your   trading   platform   is   a   fair   one   and   the   indicative  
or   intraday   NAV   (iNAV)   serves   as   that   reference.   AMCs   usually   calculate   this  
every   10-15   seconds   and   publish   it   on   their   websites.   iNAV   =   last   traded   price  
of   all   the   securities   in   the   ETF   basket   X   number   of   shares   in   the   ETF   creation  
basket   +   cash   component   (i.e.   cash   which   is   not   deployed   in   the   ETF)   divided  
by   total   ETF   shares   in   the   creation   basket.   Put   simply;   this   serves   as   a  
real-time   NAV   so   that   you   can   use   this   as   a   fair   value   reference   to   compare   it  
with   the   current   market   price   on   the   stock   exchanges.   
Creation   unit   
Like   buying   ETF   units   on   the   stock   exchange,   you   can   also   buy   units   directly  
from   the   AMC.   I'll   explain   why   you'd   want   to   do   that   later.   But,   unlike   the  
exchanges,   you   cannot   buy   1   or   2   units   directly   from   the   AMC.   You   can   only  
create   and   redeem   units   in   what's   called   the   creation   size   that   the   AMC  
defines.   A   creation   unit   is   nothing   but   a   representative   basket   of   all   the  
securities   in   the   same   proportion   as   the   underlying   index.   For   example,   the  
zerodha.com/varsity    
382    

383    
creation   unit   size   of   the   ICICI   Niy   50   ETF   is   50,000   units,   and   as   of   this  
writing,   it's   about   Rs   80   lakhs.   Meaning,   you   need   80   lakhs   to   buy   all   the  
stocks   in   Niy   50   in   the   same   weight.   
Market   makers   and   authorized   participants   (APs)    
Unlike   mutual   funds,   there's   another   entity   called   market   markers   or  
authorized   participants   in   the   ETF   ecosystem.   The   role   of   these   guys   is   to  
provide   liquidity   on   the   stock   exchanges.   You   don't   have   to   worry   about  
liquidity   in   a   mutual   fund   because   there's   no   real-time   trading.   But   since   an  
ETF   trades   real-time   on   the   exchange,   market   makers   are   appointed   by   the  
AMC   to   provide   liquidity   continuously.   They   do   this   by   providing   continuous  
two-way   quotes   on   the   exchange,   meaning   they   buy   at   the    bid    and   sell   at   the  
oﬀer ,   and   the   diﬀerence   is   the   profit   they   make.   Even   though   these   are   small  
amounts,   since   they   keep   doing   this,   it   tends   to   add   up.   
Market   makers   typically   tend   to   be   large   brokers   in   India.   
Premiums   and   discounts   
Since   an   ETF   trades   real-time   on   the   exchanges,   their   price   is   influenced   by  
demand   and   supply-the   prices   of   liquid   ETFs   trade   in   line   with   the   NAV   of   the  
ETF   most   of   the   time.   But   sometimes,   particularly   during   volatile   market  
phases,   the   price   of   an   ETF   can   trade   away   from   the   NAV   of   the   ETF.   If   the  
price   of   an   ETF   is   above   its   NAV,   it's   called   a   premium   and   if   the   price   is   below  
it's   NAV,   it's   called   a   discount.   
Tracking   error   
zerodha.com/varsity

384    
Tracking   error   is   the   annualized   standard   deviation   of   the   diﬀerence   between  
the   ETF   NAV   returns   and   the   index   that   it   tracks.   In   simple   terms,   it   shows   you  
how   closely   an   ETF   tracks   its   underlying   benchmark.   A   simple   example   would  
be   if   Niy   50   returned   10%   and   Niy   ETF   gave   9.8%,   the   tracking   error   would  
be   0.2%.   An   ETF   or   an   index   fund   will   have   lower   returns   than   the   index  
because   they   have   an   expense   ratio   and   an   index   doesn't.   
A   lower   tracking   error   indicates   that   an   ETF   or   an   index   fund   is   tracking   the  
index   better.   But   this   is   not   really   an   intuitive   measure   to   understand   and  
we'll   discuss   that   later.   
With   these   concepts   in   mind,   let's   get   back   to   the   concept   of   creation   and  
redemption   mechanism   
There   are   a   few   reasons   why   the   creation   and   redemption   mechanism   is  
important.   For   one,   you   need   not   always   buy   an   ETF   on   the   stock   exchange.   If  
you   are   buying   in   multiples   of   the   creation   unit   size,   buying   it   directly   from  
the   AMC   is   way   better   because   you   might   face   liquidity   issues   and   impact  
costs   when   you   buy   large   quantities   on   the   exchange.   
So,   in   the   example   I   mentioned   above,   the   ICICI   Niy   50   ETF's   creation   size   is  
roughly   80   lakhs.   If   you   are   investing   in   multiples   of   80   lakhs,   you   can   directly  
contact   ICICI,   and   they   will   create   units,   in   this   case,   50,000   units   and   credit  
them   to   your   demat.   The   AMC   will   create   units   at   the   iNAV.    Similarly,   you   can  
redeem   them   by   transferring   the   ETF   units   to   ICICI,   and   they   will   credit   the  
cash   to   your   bank   account   or   you   can   also   get   the   underlying   shares   instead  
of   cash.   

385    
The   second   reason   why   creation   and   redemption   mechanisms   are   important  
is   for   ETF   arbitrage.   Like   I   mentioned   earlier,   ETFs   can   trade   at   premiums   and  
discounts   to   the   NAV.   Market   makers   are   essential   in   the   ETF   ecosystem  
because   they   are   responsible   for   correcting   these   premiums   and   discounts. 
They   do   this   through   the   creation   and   redemption   mechanism.   
Typically   ETFs   trade   close   to   their   NAVs.   Here's   a   comparison   of   Niy   BeEs,  
SBI   Niy   ETF,   ICICI   ETF   and   Niy   50.   
 
Niy   ETFs   vs   Niy   50   
But   during   a   volatile   market   phase,   for   example,   like   the   COVID   crash   in   2020,  
there   can   be   wide   premiums   and   discounts.   Here's   how   even   a   popular   ETF  
like   NiyBeEs   and   SBI   Niy   50   ETF,   India's   largest   mutual   fund   performed  
during   the   volatile   market   phase   of   March-April   2020.   

Nifybees   vs   Niy   50   
Now,   here's   where   the   market   makers   come   in.   If   there's   a   premium,   the  
authorized   participant   (AP)   will   buy   all   the   underlying   securities   that   make   up  
the   ETF   creation   unit.   In   this   case,   the   AP   will   buy   all   the   50   Niy   stocks   of   the  
same   weight;   this   is   also   called   the   creation   basket   and   give   them   to   the   AMC.  
In   turn,   the   AMC   will   create   ETF   shares   and   give   them   to   the   AP,   who   will   then  
sell   them   on   the   exchange.   
Similarly,   if   there's   a   discount,   the   AP   will   buy   the   ETF   units   on   the   exchange  
and   give   them   to   the   AMC.   In   return,   the   AMC   will   give   the   underlying   shares  
of   the   ETF   to   the   AP,   who   will,   in   turn,   sell   them   in   the   market.   The   diﬀerence  
between   the   premium,   discount,   and   the   NAV   will   be   the   AP/market   maker's  
profit.   
Perhaps,   the   best   example   of   this   would   be   the   Motilal   Oswal   NASDAQ   100 
(N100).   During   2017-2018,   the   ETF   was   trading   at   a   huge   premium   to   the   NAV.  
The   premiums   were   as   high   as   20%+.   This   was   probably   because   the   market  
makers   weren't   active   in   providing   liquidity.   Value   Research   allows   you   to  
zerodha.com/varsity

387    
compare   the   NAV   and   price ,   here's   a   chart,   notice   the   huge   diﬀerence  
between   the   NAV   and   the   price.   
Someone   could   have   taken   advantage   of   this   premium   by   going   to   Motilal  
AMC   and   asking   them   to   create   units,   which   happens   at   the   NAV   and   sell   them  
at   the   market   price   on   the   exchange.   The   diﬀerence   would've   been   the   profit.   
 
N100   ETF   price   vs   NAV   
This   premium   persisted   for   a   long   time.   Then   Motilal,   If   I'm   not   wrong,  
appointed   new   market   makers   and   launched   a   fund   of   funds   (FOF)   for   the  
ETF,   which   corrected   the   premium.   So   the   market   maker   around   2018   would  
have   created   Motilal   units   at   the   NAV   and   sold   them   on   the   exchange   at   the  
market   price   and   corrected   the   premium.   

N100   ETF   price   vs   NAV   
This   is   how   the   creation   and   redemption   mechanism   in   an   ETF   is   used   to  
ensure   liquidity   and   arbitrage   premiums   and   discounts.   
29.7   -   ETF   liquidity   
This   is   the   most   important   thing   when   buying   or   selling   an   ETF   because   they  
trade   real-time.   When   choosing   an   ETF,   most   people   tend   to   look   at   the   AUM  
of   an   ETF   and   the   trading   volumes   to   decide   if   an   ETF   is   liquid.   Although   these  
2   things   should   be   considered,   the   size   of   an   ETF   or   the   daily   trading   volumes  
alone   don't   indicate   liquidity.   
Let's   unpack   what   ETF   liquidity   really   means.   It's   essential   to   remember   at  
this   point   that   even   though   ETFs   trade   like   stocks,   they   are   not   the   same.   

Layers   of   ETF   liquidity   -American   Century   
   
Secondary   market   liquidity:    This   is   what   you   see   on   your   trading   platform.  
The   spread   between   the   bids   and   oﬀers   give   you   an   idea   of   the   available  
liquidity,   but   that's   not   all.   Take   a   look   at   this   image,   comparing   Mirae   Niy   50  
ETF   and   LIC   Niy   50   ETF.   The   LIC   ETF   has   an   AUM   of   Rs   618   crs,   and   the   Mirae  
ETF   has   about   483   crs.   As   of   writing   this   post,   both   the   ETFs   had   just   traded  
500+   units.   

Typically,   you'd   ignore   both   ETFs   assuming   that   they   are   too   small   and   don't  
trade   much.   But   that   would   be   an   incorrect   assumption   because   on-screen  
liquidity   isn't   everything.   
ETF   market   depth:    If   you   look   at   the   Mirae   ETF,   nearly   60,000   shares   are  
available   for   purchase.   That   means,   even   if   you   place   a   market   order,   which   is  
a   really   terrible   mistake   when   buying   an   ETF,   you   will   get   a   good   fill   at   Rs  
157.44.   This   is   probably   a   market   maker   posting   a   bid   and   an   oﬀer.   The   LIC  
ETF,   on   the   other   hand,   has   no   liquidity   at   all.   If   you'd   have   placed   a   market  
order   for   100   units   by   chance,   your   average   price   would   have   been   way   higher  
than   the   last   traded   price,   given   that   there   are   no   volumes   and   your   order  
would've   been   continuously   executed   at   higher   and   higher   prices.   
So,   AUM   and   trading   volumes   don't   tell   you   everything.   Market   markers  
typically   hold   units   that   don't   show   up   in   the   market   depth.   If   you   place   a  
limit   order   to   buy,   your   order   will   be   executed   as   the   market   makers   place   an  

order   to   sell.   But   yeah,   not   all   ETFs   have   active   market   makers,   this   has   to   be  
part   of   your   ETF   due   diligence   which   we'll   talk   about   in   a   bit.   
Here's   how   the   Mirae   ETF   and   LIC   ETF   have   tracked   Niy   50.   While   Mirae   has  
closely   tracked   Niy   50,   LIC   has   been   all   over   the   place   trading   at   premiums  
and   discounts.   
 
Mirae   vs   LIC   Niy   50   ETF   
Primary   market:    The   third   layer   of   ETF   liquidity   is   the   primary   liquidity.  
Remember,   a   stock   has   a   fixed   number   of   shares   on   oﬀer,   But   even   though   an  
ETF   trades   like   a   stock,   it's   not   a   stock.   Market   makers   and   investors   can  
create   new   ETF   units.   Large   institutions,   HNIs,   typically   don't   buy   ETFs   on   the  
exchange.   They   directly   reach   out   to   the   AMC   and   create   units   that   don't  
show   up   on   your   trading   platforms'   market   depth.   
Liquidity   of   the   underlying   stocks:    The   last   and   the   most   important   layer   of  
ETF   liquidity   is   how   liquid   the   underlying   stocks   that   make   up   an   ETF   are.  
Remember,   an   ETF   is   just   a   wrapper   that   holds   all   the   stocks   that   make   up   the  
ETF   or   an   index.   So,   an   ETF   can   only   be   as   liquid   as   the   underlying   stocks.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
391    

392    
This   might   be   a   little   confusing,   so   let's   take   an   example.   Today,   in   India,   we  
don't   yet   have   a   small-cap   ETF,   have   you   ever   wondered   why?   In   the   Indian  
markets,   the   liquidity   quickly   starts   disappearing   aer   the   200   largest   stocks.  
As   we   go   down   the   market   cap,   the   smaller   stocks   tend   to   have   less  
outstanding   shares,   less   trading   volumes,   and   usually   keep   hitting   upper   and  
lower   circuits.   
So,   assuming   there   was   a   small-cap   ETF   and   that   there   was   a   sudden   spike   in  
demand,   the   market   maker   would   have   had   to   create   units   to   satisfy   the 
demand.   Now   if   some   of   the   underlying   stocks   are   not   liquid   or   have   hit  
circuits,   which   is   quite   common   in   small-caps,   he   wouldn't   have   been   able   to  
create   units.   In   such   a   case,   the   ETF   will   probably   trade   at   a   premium   to   the  
NAV   because   there   will   be   more   demand   for   the   existing   units.   Not   just,  
small-caps,   even   mid-cap   stocks   in   India   have   liquidity   issues.   So,   an   ETF   can  
only   be   as   liquid   as   it's   underlying   stocks.   But   this   isn't   a   problem   in   a  
large-cap   ETF   like   a   Niy   50   ETF   because   these   are   the   biggest   and   the   most  
liquid   stocks.   
To   summarize,   trading   volumes   and   AUM   are   factors,   but   they   don't   tell   you  
everything   about   an   ETF.   
29.8   -   ETF   choices   in   India   
Like   I   mentioned   at   the   start   of   the   chapter,   ETFs   are   pretty   new   in   India,   we  
have   about   88   ETFs   today.   A   majority   of   them   are   equity   ETFs.   Here   are   your  
ETF   choices:   
1. Equity   ETFs   
There   broadly   2   sub-categories   of   equity   ETFs.   You   have   your   plain  
zerodha.com/varsity    
392    

393    
vanilla    market-cap-weighted   ETFs    that   track   indices   like   the   Niy   50,  
Niy   100,   Sensex   etc.   And   then   you   have    smart   beta   ETFs    which   target  
factors   such   as   value,   quality,   low-volatility,   momentum   etc.   
2. Debt   ETFs   
We   have   debt   G-sec   ETFs,   Bharat   bond   ETF   which   just   holds   bonds  
issued   by   PSUs,   and   then   you   have   an   ETF   like   the   CPSE+SDL   ETF   by  
Nippon   which   holds   PSU   bonds   and   State   development   loans   (SDLs).   
3. Commodity   ETFs   
For   now,   we   just   have   gold   ETFs.   
Here's   a    list   of   all   Indian   ETFs .   
Are   all   ETFs   passive?   
This   is   a   common   question   that   keeps   coming   up.   Today,   the   biggest   ETFs   we  
have   are   passive   ETFs   that   track   either   the   Niy   50   or   Sensex   30.   But   smart  
beta   ETFs   aren't   passive,   even   though   the   ETFs   track   an   index.   They   are   more  
of   a   hybrid   of   active   &   passive   like   we   discussed   in   the    smart   beta   chapter .  
Globally,   80-90%   of   all   ETFs   are   passive,   but   we   see   the   first   traditional   active  
ETFs   in   the   US.   Maybe,   we'll   eventually   see   them   in   India   as   well.   So   ETFs  
need   not   be   all   passive,   it's   just   that   they   are   passive   today.   
ETF   due   diligence   
I   know   this   has   been   a   little   long,   but   the   idea   was   to   give   you   the   full   context  
you   need   before   investing   in   an   ETF   and   help   you   avoid   rude   surprises.   And   I  
hope   at   this   point;   you   have   a   clear   understanding   of   how   an   ETF   works   and  

394    
its   mechanics.   With   that   in   mind,   let's   now   look   at   some   things   you   should  
consider   before   you   buy   an   ETF.   
Always   use   limit   orders   
I   cannot   stress   this   enough   but   never   use   market   orders   when   buying   an   ETF,  
always   use   limit   orders.   This   is   one   mistake   I   see   investors   constantly   make.  
We   saw   this   earlier   but   let   me   reiterate   this   with   an   example.   Take   a   look   at  
the   market   depth   of   Aditya   Birla   Sun   Life   Niy   Next   50   ETF.   If   you   placed   a  
market   order   for   200   units,   your   order   would   be   executed   at   prices   starting  
from   Rs   350,   which   is   above   the   LTP,   to   begin   with,   and   finally,   at   Rs   374,   that's  
8.7%   higher   than   the   LTP.    So,   always   use   limit   orders.   

Always   check   the   iNAV   
Always   look   at   the   iNAV   on   the   AMC   website   and   place   a   limit   order   at   that  
level.   Don't   just   place   a   limit   order   without   looking   at   the   iNAV.   The   other  
issue   is   that   sometimes   AMC   websites   don't   update   their   iNAVs   or   their  
websites   might   be   down.   If   there   is   a   big   diﬀerence   between   the   last   updated  
iNAV   and   the   current   market   price,   that's   a   sign   that   there   is   something  
wrong.   So,   make   sure   to   compare   the   ETF   with   the   intraday   chart   of   the  
underlying   index   of   the   ETF   on   Kite,   and   that   will   give   you   an   indication   if   the  
price   is   correct.   Check   with   the   AMC   in   such   a   case   before   placing   an   order.   
Compare   the   NAV   and   the   price   of   an   ETF   and   see   how   it   has   performed   
You   should   always   buy   an   ETF   that   tracks   the   underlying   index   as   closely   as  
possible.   Here's   how   Nippon   NiyBeEs   ETF   has   tracked   it's   NAV,   it's   pretty  
close.   You   can   compare   the   price   and   the   NAV   on    Value   Research ;   we'll   try  
having   this   feature   on   Coin.   

Picking   up   on   the   earlier   point   about   the   tracking   error,   AMCs   disclose   the  
tracking   error   on   their   factsheets.   But   if   you   see   a   tracking   error   as   0.02%,   it's  
hard   to   understand   what   it   means.   Moreover,   AMCs   calculate   the   tracking  
error   on   the   NAV,   but   you   buy   and   sell   based   on   the   price,   which   can   be   totally  
diﬀerent.   So   the   best   way   to   analyse   an   ETF   is   to   look   at   the   diﬀerence  
between   ETF   prices   and   the   underlying   index.   You   want   the   price   of   ETF   to  
track   the   index   consistently   without   huge   diﬀerences.   
Note:    Always   compare   the   ETF   price   with   the    total   returns   index   (TRI)    and  
not   the   price   returns   the   index   (PRI).   The   TRI   includes   dividends.   All   the  
index   data   you   see   on   Kite   is   PRI.   Since   ETFs   track   TRI   indices,   they  
reinvest   the   dividends   which   reflects   in   the   NAV   of   the   ETF.    
Look   at   the   average   volumes   
Look   at   the   average   volumes   over   a   period   of   time   and   see   how   an   ETF   has  
traded.   You   should   invest   in   an   ETF   that   trades   regularly.   You   should   avoid  
ETFs   that   just   have   a   brief   spike   in   volumes   and   then   don't   trade.   The  
Edelweiss   ETF   -   Niy   100   Quality   30   is   an   example.   The   monthly   average  
volumes   are   about   150   units.   You   can   check   the   average   volumes   by   applying  
a   moving   average   on   the   volume   chart   on   Kite.   So   assuming   you   had   bought  
this   ETF   and   had   to   exit,   you   most   likely   wouldn't   have   been   able   to.   

Avoid   buying   and   selling   at   market   open   
Most   ETFs   don't   trade   much   for   30   mins   to   1   hour   of   the   market   open.   They  
also   tend   to   trade   at   abnormal   prices   because   of   the   low   volumes,   even  
orders   for   a   few   units   can   move   prices.   If   you   can,   avoid   trading   in   the   open.  
And   if   you   have   to,   check   and   verify   the   iNAV   and   use   limit   orders. 
Is   the   AMC   focussed   on   ETFs?   
Today,   most   of   the   AMCs   oﬀer   ETFs   but   that   doesn&apos;t   mean   they   are   serious  
about   them.   Most   of   the   ETF   volumes   are   in   ETFs   oﬀered   by   Nippon,   ICICI,  
and   SBI   largely.   Other   AMCs   like   Mirae,   Edelweiss   with   their   debt   ETFs   do  
seem   serious   about   building   out   their   ETF   oﬀerings.   So,   along   with   the   other  
things   on   the   due   diligence   list,   you'll   also   have   to   look   at   whether   an   AMC   is  
serious   about   the   ETFs   it   oﬀers.   For   example,   if   you   look   at   some   of   the   ETFs  
by   Aditya   Birla   Mutual   Fund,   IDBI,   LIC,   Indiabulls   etc.,   they   have   horrible  
tracking   errors   and   almost   no   volumes.   

Creating   units   with   the   AMC   for   higher-value   investments   
If   your   investments   in   ETFs   are   equal   to   or   more   than   the   creation   basket  
value,   it's   better   if   you   approach   the   AMC   to   create   units   rather   then   buying  
on   the   stock   exchange.   
29.9   -   ETF   vs   index   funds   
This   is   another   question   that   keeps   coming   up.   Hopefully,   this   table   should  
help   answer   these   questions.   In   short,   if   you   want   to   have   active   control   or   if  
you   are   actively   using   passive   ETFs,   then   ETFs   are   a   better   choice.   But   if   you  
are   lazy   like   me   and   want   to   make   as   few   choices   as   possible,   then   index  
funds   are   a   better   choice.   
With   ETFs,   you   can   express   tactical   strategies   better   than   index   funds   because  
you   can't   buy   and   sell   index   funds   immediately.   

29.10   -   Performance   of   ETFs   vs   actively   managed   funds   
We   discussed   this   earlier   in   the    index   funds   chapter    as   well.   In   the   last   decade  
or   so,   index   funds   and   ETFs   have   become   increasingly   popular   around   the  
world.   One   reason   is   that   investors   have   increasingly   realized   that   a   vast  
majority   of   actively   managed   mutual   funds   don't   beat   their   benchmarks.   In   a  
developed   market   like   the   US,     ~90%    of   active   funds   don't   beat   their  
benchmarks.   
The   Indian   markets   have   grown   a   fair   bit   and   have   become   increasingly  
professionalized;   institutional   investors   are   a   big   part   of   today's   market.   This  
means   that   most   of   the   informational   edges   and   asymmetries   have   been  
arbitraged   away.   Today,   pretty   much   everyone   has   access   to   the   same  
information.   The   odds   of   someone   finding   some   piece   of   information   that   can  
move   a   stock,   at   least   in   the   large-cap   space,   for   example,   is   pretty   much   zero.  
zerodha.com/varsity    
400    
Index   funds   tend   to   hold   more   cash  
and   hence   have   a   slightly   higher  
tracking   error   
ETFs   don't   hold   much   cash   and  
hence   have   a   lower   tracking   error   
Lesser   choice   at-least   as   of   now.   But  
AMCs   are   launching   a   fund   of   funds  
for   ETFs   
Pretty   much   all   of   the   smart-beta  
products   are   ETFs.   You   have   a   wider 
choice   




401    
But   perhaps   the   biggest   reason   why   active   funds   underperform   is   that   they  
charge   too   much.   
Actively   managed   large-cap   funds   on   an   average   charge~1.5%   whereas   a   Niy  
50   index   fund   is   available   for   0.10%.   And   we   see   this   in   the   performance.   S&P  
publishes   a    report   called   SPIVA ,   which   measures   the   performance   of   active  
funds.   For   any   period,   over   70%   of   all   large-cap   funds   fail   to   beat   their  
benchmarks.   
 
SPIVA   India   
Traditionally,   the   view   was   that   the   mid-cap   and   small-cap   space   was  
ineﬀicient,   and   this   was   where   stock   pickers   thrived.   While   this   was   true,   it  
seems   like   this   is   increasingly   becoming   less   so.   In   the   last   5   years   since   the  
SEBI   categorization   exercise,   active   mid-cap   funds   have   had   a   tough   time  
keeping   up   with   a   broad   mid-cap   benchmark   like   the   Niy   50   or   BSE/NSE 
Mid-cap   150   index   and   even   Niy   Next   50   etc.   Here's   a   quick   look,   this   is   just  
for   illustration,   and   ideally,   you   should   look   at   the    rolling   returns .   

The   bottom   line   is   that   most   actively   managed   funds   don't   outperform   a  
simple   broad-market   ETFs   or   index   funds   like   Niy   50,   Niy   Next   50   and   Niy  
Midcap   150.   This   is   due   to   a   combination   of   high   costs,   increasing   market  
eﬀiciency,   and   internal   fund   mandates   to   not   deviate   too   much   from   the  
indices.   Moreover,   it's   tough   to   pick   those   funds   &   managers   that   beat   their  
benchmarks.   And   even   if   you   figure   out   how   to   pick   a   winning   manager,   there  
is   very   little   persistence   in   performance.   The   best   performing   fund   oen   ends  
up   being   the   worst-performing   fund   over   a   period   of   time.   
Today,   it's   a   no-brainer   to   look   at   index   funds   in   the   large-cap   space.   There's  
increasing   evidence   that   it's   the   same   in   the   mid-cap   space   as   well.   As   for  
small-caps,   these   are   severely   risky   and   buy   and   hold   may   not   be   an   optimal  
strategy,   and   active   management   both   in   a   fund   and   in   timing   is   needed.   
Key   takeaways   from   this   chapter   
● ETFs   trade   real-time   on   the   stock   exchanges   and   you   can   now  
set-up   SIPs   in   ETFs   to   invest   every   month   
● Blindly   choosing   an   ETF   is   a   bad   idea.   ETF   due   diligence   before  
investing   is   extremely   important   
● ETF   liquidity   is   an   issue   in   India   because   our   are   markets   are  
still   small   and   this   needs   to   be   kept   in   mind   when   buying   and  
selling   
● Always   use   limit   orders   and   compare   the   market   price   of   the  
ETF   with   the   intraday   or   indicative   NAV   (iNAV)   before   buying  
and   selling   
zerodha.com/varsity    
405    

406    
● You   can   check   the   iNAV   on   the   respective   AMC's   website   
● Sometimes   the   iNAVs   on   AMC   sites   may   be   wrong.   If   the  
diﬀerence   between   iNAV   and   the   price   is   huge,   it's   a   red   flag.   
● Compare   the   ETF   price   with   the   underlying   index   or   check  
with   the   AMC   in   cases   where   the   ETF   prices   are   way   oﬀ   from  
the   iNAVs/NAVs   
● Large-cap   and   mid-cap   Index   ETFs   make   a   lot   of   sense   vs  
actively   managed   large-cap   and   mid-cap   index   funds   

CHAPTER    30   
Basics   of   Macro   Economics   
  
30.1   -   Why   macroeconomics?   
The   module   on   Personal   Finance   has   come   a   long   way   with   over   30   chapters.   I  
can   easily   think   of   another   10   or   15   chapters   to   add,   but   I   won't   do   that   
🙂
   
I   think   we   have   covered   the   major   chunk   of   personal   finance,   i.e.   investments  
(via   mutual   funds),   and   in   the   process,   discussed   a   ton   of   other   information.   I  
hope   you've   found   this   module   useful.   
I   want   to   end   this   module   with   a   chapter   on   MacroEconomics.   
Macroeconomics   in   a   personal   finance   module?   Well,   I'm   sure   you   may  
wonder   why   I'd   want   to   discuss   macroeconomics   in   a   personal   finance  
module.   Aer   all,   personal   finance   is   related   to   an   individual   or   a   family's  
finances.   On   the   other   hand,   macroeconomics   is   a   much   wider   topic   related  
to   a   country's   economic   well-fare.   
What   is   the   connection   here?   
You   like   it   or   not;   your   financial   fortune   is   highly   dependent   on   how   the  
country   as   a   whole   does;   this   is   especially   true   when   you   save   for   long   and  
hyper   long-term   investment   goals   like   retirement. 
Imagine   this;   you   set   retirement   as   your   financial   goal.   As   a   part   of   this,   you  
do   your   bit   diligently,   i.e.   select   your   mutual   funds   carefully,   save   regularly,  
zerodha.com/varsity    
407    

408    
increment   your   savings   by   the   year,   and   stick   to   the   course   and   not   succumb  
to   the   temptation   of   pulling   out   the   funds   during   the   tenure.   
However,   the   country   you   reside   in   happens   to   default   on   its   borrowings   and  
suﬀers   from   never-ending   geopolitical   and   civil   unrest.   
Given   the   situation,   do   you   think   your   savings   will   do   well?   
Or   think   about   a   situation   in   your   country   at   the   cusp   of   a   big   bang   economic  
reform,   with   an   extremely   supportive   demographic   profile   and   a  
super-competent   Government.   But   you   fail   to   see   through   these   shining  
opportunities   and   instead   decide   to   play   safe   and   invest   your   hard-earned  
money   in   gold.   
Do   you   think   you'd   have   taken   the   right   investment   decision   here?   
Hence,   for   this   reason,   I   think   it   is   very   important   for   an   individual   to  
understand   the   basic   macroeconomic   profile   of   the   country   and   map   it   to   the  
past   macroeconomic   profile   and   extrapolate   a   bit   to   the   future   and   see   how  
the   situation   pans   out.   
In   this   chapter,   I'll   stick   to   basics   and   help   you   understand   the   absolute  
essential   macroeconomic   principles.   If   the   topic   interests   you'd,   I'd   suggest  
you   pick   up   any   good   undergraduate   book   on   macroeconomics   and   read  
through   it.   I'm   sure   you   won't   regret   it

30.2   -   Gross   Domestic   Product   (GDP)   
I   understand   this   is   an   absolute   basic   metric   to   start   our   discussion,   but   we  
will   start   with   it   for   the   same   reason.   Many   of   you   may   be   familiar   with   it;   if  
yes,   please   feel   free   to   skip   this   section.   For   those   who   are   not   familiar   with  
'GDP',   let   me   tell   you   a   quick   story.   
Aer   my   sister's   marriage   in   2002,   she   moved   to   Coimbatore,   Tamil   Nadu.   I  
was   in   my   early   20's,   and   I'd   oen   make   weekend   trips   to   Coimbatore   to   visit  
her   and   spend   a   few   days   with   her.   My   sister   had   a   very   interesting   neighbour  
in   Coimbatore,   and   she   would   oen   tell   me   stories   about   them.   On   one   of   my  
visits,   I   got   to   meet   the   neighbours   as   well.   
The   neighbour's   house   had   three   family   members   -   husband   and   wife,   both  
in   their   mid   50's   and   a   teenage   daughter.   Husband   managed   a   steel  
kitchenware   shop,   which   sold   household   items   like   rice   cooker,   pots,   and  
pans.   His   wife   managed   a   small   homemade   papad   and   pickle   business,   and  
the   teenage   daughter   taught   classical   dance   to   the   neighbourhood   kids.   
All   three   members   of   the   house   had   an   economic   output.   Given   my  
unnecessary   curiosity,   I   remember   trying   to   figure   out   how   much   money   this  
family   made.   I   don't   remember   the   exact   math,   but   I   remember   these  
numbers;   I   estimated   that   -   
○ The   husband   sold   goods   worth   2   to   2.5L   lakhs   per   month.   
○ The   wife   sold   goods   worth   25K   every   month.   
○ The   daughter   charged   500   per   month   per   kid   and   had   ten  
students,   which   was   5K   per   month.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
409    

410    
Give   or   take,   this   small   and   admirable   family's   monthly   income   was   anywhere  
between   2.3   to   2.8L   per   month   or   about   34L   per   year   on   a   gross   basis.   This  
family   had   no   other   source   of   income.   In   other   words,   34L   was   the   total  
economic   output   of   this   family   aer   accounting   for   all   the   products   and  
services   collectively   sold   by   this   family.   
 
In   a   sense,   I   think   it   is   ok   to   conclude   that   the   family's   Gross   Domestic  
Product&apos;   (GDP)   was   34L   per   year.    If   you   realized,   GDP   here   represents   the  
total   value   of   the   economic   output   of   the   family,   which   includes   goods   sold  
(kitchenware),   products   manufactured   and   sold   (papad   and   pickle),   and  
services   oﬀered   (dance   classes).   
Now   step   aside   and   think   about   the   country   as   a   whole.   The   country   has  
many   factories,   companies,   services   units   of   various   kinds;   all   of   these  
collectively   have   an   economic   output.   The   combined   economic   value   of   all  
these   entities   (operating   within   the   geographic   boundaries   of   the   country)  
zerodha.com/varsity    
410    

411    
represents   the   GDP   of   the   country.   If   the   companies   do   well   and   thrive,   then  
naturally,   the   GDP   of   the   country   increases.   
Or   in   other   words,   a   growing   GDP   is   a   healthy   economic   sign.   We   all   want   the  
GDP   of   the   country   to   increase.   
Have   a   look   at   the   Indian   GDP   ranking   -   
 
I've   got   this   from   Wikipedia,   where   they   have   tabulated   the   2020   GDP   rank   of  
countries   as   per   various   estimates   (IMF,   World   Bank,   and   UN).   
India   ranks   around   6th   or   5th,   and   the   GDP   itself   is   pegged   to   2.6   to   2.9  
Trillion   USD.   Do   recollect,   the   collective   economic   output   of   India   is  
estimated   between   2.6   -   2.9   Trillion   USD.   We   are   just   below   China,   Japan,   UK,  
and   Germany.   
While   it   is   great   to   know   we   are   in   the   top   5   GDPs   of   the   world,   it   is   also  
important   to   understand   how   our   GDP   grows.   Aer   all,   we   want   to   be   better  
than   being   in   the   top   5,   and   we   want   to   get   there   as   quickly   as   possible.   
To   measure   the   speed   at   which   a   country's   GDP   is   growing,   we   need   a   growth  
rate.   The   number   is   usually   expressed   in   percentage   terms.   Hence,   if   the  
percentage   is   5%,   it   implies   that   a   country's   GDP   grows   at   5%.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
411    

412    
The   technique   of   estimating   the   GDP   growth   rate   is   beyond   this   discussion's  
scope;   we   won't   get   into   that   today   but   will   use   the   widely   accepted   number.   
Now,   when   it   comes   to   measuring   the   GDP   growth,   there   are   two   terms   you  
should   familiarize   yourself   with   -   
○ The   nominal   GDP   growth   rate   
○ The   real   GDP   growth   rate   
Both   these   growth   rates   measure   the   speed   at   which   the   GDP   grows;   if   you  
guessed   right,   these   rates   are   the   CAGR   of   the   GDP.   Do   recollect;   we   have  
discussed   CAGR   several   times   in   this   module.   
To   put   this   in   context,   take   a   look   at   this   new   paper   headlines   -   
 
   
The   reference   point   here   is   the   'nominal   growth'   rate.   
The   nominal   growth   rate   is   the   absolute   growth   rate.   While   it   is   ok   to   use   the  
nominal   growth   rate,   it   may   not   be   an   accurate   representation   of   ground  
realities.   
Let   me   explain.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
412    

413    
Think   of   it   as   investing   Rs.100   in   stock.   At   a   10%   growth   rate   and   five   years,  
Rs.100   grows   to   Rs.161/-.   But   is   the   value   of   Rs.161/-   in   5   years   the   same   as  
Rs.161/-   today?   Won't   it   be   right?   And   we   know   it   won't   be   the   same   because  
inflation   eats   into   the   purchasing   power   of   money   on   year   on   year   basis.   
Hence   to   get   the   most   accurate   representation,   we   need   to   adjust   the   growth  
rate   to   inflation.   When   we   adjust   the   nominal   GDP   growth   rate   to   inflation   in  
GDP,   we   get   the   real   GDP   growth   rate.   
Real   GDP   growth   =   Nominal   GDP   growth   -   Inflation.   
Assuming   the   inflation   at   around   4.5%   (ranges   between   4.5%   to   5%),   real   GDP  
of   India   -   
10%   -   4.5%   
=   5.5%   
Do   take   a   look   at   this   snapshot;   it   estimates   the   real   GDP   growth   at   5%   -   
 
The   snapshot   is   from   the   Department   of   Economic   Aﬀairs;   you   can   read   the  
entire   paper   here   -    https://dea.gov.in/sites/default/files/March%202020.pdf .   
I   also   found   this   interesting   chart   from   the   same   paper;   I   thought   I'd   share   it  
here   for   your   quick   reference   -   

Thanks   to   COVID,   most   of   the   economies   (from   the   GDP   perspective)   took   a  
hit   in   2020.   But   they   are   all   expected   to   bounce   back   up   in   2021   and   perhaps  
2022.   Whether   this   will   pan   out   as   per   estimates   or   not   is   an   unknown.   But   the  
stock   markets   at   least   seem   to   factor   this   
🙂
   
Anyway,   at   this   point,   I   want   you   to   take   a   break   and   think   about   this   -   
○ You   understood   what   GDP   is   
○ You   understood   the   GDP   growth   rate,   both   nominal   and   real.   
How   is   this   relevant   to   personal   finance?   
30.3   -   GDP   and   Market   cap   
We   have   discussed   the   concept   of   market   cap   earlier   in   Varsity.   For   those   of  
you   not   familiar   with   market   cap,   here   is   a   quick   note   -   

Assume   the   stock   price   of   a   certain   company   is   Rs.75/-   per   share.   Further,  
assume   that   the   company   has   only   1000   shares   outstanding   of   this   company.   
The   market   cap   of   this   company   is   -   
Stock   price   x   total   outstanding   shares   
=   75   x   1000   
=   Rs.75,000/-   
The   total   outstanding   shares   of   this   company   are   constant,   but   the   stock   price 
fluctuates   daily.   The   higher   the   stock   price,   the   higher   is   the   market   cap   and  
vice   versa. 
Now   assume   another   company   has   2000   shares   outstanding,   and   the   stock  
price   is   105   per   share.   The   market   cap   of   this   company   is   -   
=   105   x   2000   
=2,10,000/-   
Now   assume   (the   last   assumption,   I   promise)   that   the   entire   market  
comprises   just   these   two   companies.   The   entire   market   cap   of   this   market   is   -   
75000   +   210000   
=2,85,000/-   
Hopefully,   with   this   arbitrary   example,   you   got   a   sense   of   the   concept   of  
'market   cap   of   the   market'.   The   market   cap   of   Indian   companies   (sum   of   the 
market   cap   of   all   the   listed   companies   in   the   country)   as   of   Jan   2021   is  
roughly   $2.5   Trillion.   

 
One   of   the   direct   established   correlations   is   that   as   the   country's   GDP  
improves,   so   will   the   market   cap.   If   the   market   cap   does   well,   then   equity  
investments   are   bound   to   well.   We   have   seen   this   happen   in   the   past.   
So   when   you   look   at   the   GDP   data,   think   about   how   the   country   is   placed   in  
terms   of   GDP,   and   it   is   expected   to   do   over   the   next   5   or   10   years.   
For   instance,   here   is   a   thought   about   the   Indian   GDP   situation   -   
○ India   is   a   2.6   Trillion   USD   GDP   as   of   2021   
○ The   real   GDP   growth   rate   is   5.5%   
○ The   countries   above   us   in   the   GDP   rank,   i.e.   Japan,   Germany,   and  
the   UK,   have   large   GDPs,   but   their   real   growth   rates   are   lower. 
Even   if   India   did   nothing   spectacular   or   did   nothing   stupid   to   degrow,   then  
under   a   decent   real   GDP   growth   rate   (and   slow   down   in   developed   countries), 
the   GDP   rank   is   bound   to   increase.   

No   think   about   a   growing   GDP   plus   the   largest   democracy   globally,   and   top   it  
up   with   a   large   working   population;   what   do   you   expect?   
Well,   these   are   factors   that   usually   are   a   precursor   to   attracting   more 
investment   capital   into   the   country.   With   these   investments   coming   in,  
corporates   are   expected   to   do   well,   and   in   turn,   the   country's   market   cap   is  
expected   to   do   well.   
Will   this   happen   overnight?   No.   
Will   this   happen   over   the   next   1-2   years?   Maybe   not.   
Will   this   happen   over   the   next   8-10   years?   Well,   it   seems   likely.   
Hence,   the   need   to   stay   invested   for   a   longer-term.   
30.4   -   India   Inc   
Think   about   a   corporate   entity.   A   corporate   entity   or   a   company   usually   has  
few   sources   of   revenue   and   a   set   of   expenses.   The   diﬀerence   between   the  
revenue   and   expense,   if   positive,   results   in   a   profit   to   the   company.   If   the  
diﬀerence   between   the   revenue   and   expense   is   negative,   then   that   is   a   loss   to  
the   company.   
Now   think   about   India   as   a   company.   The   company's   management   is   the  
Government,   which   is   democratically   elected.   The   company   has   a   few  
revenue   sources,   mainly   in   terms   of   taxes,   and   the   company   also   has  
expenses   mainly   in   terms   of   capital   and   revenue   expenses.   If   the   income  
minus   expense   is   positive,   that's   a   surplus   to   the   country,   else   a   deficit.   

Take   a   look   at   the   snapshot   below;   I've   got   this   from   the   website   of   Controller  
General   of   Accounts;   here   is   the   link   -   
http://www.cga.nic.in/GlanceReport/Published/2018-2019.aspx   
 
The   data   you   see   above   is   for   the   Financial   Year   2018-19,   represented   in  
Rupee   Crores.   Let   us   break   this   down   to   understand   the   numbers   better.   
The   first   line   here   details   India   Inc's   Revenue;   it   is   called   the   'Revenue  
Receipts'.   These   receipts   act   as   the   sources   of   revenue   for   the   Government.  
There   are   two   broad   categories   of   revenue   for   the   Government,   i.e.   Taxes   and  
Non-tax   revenue.   
Taxes   Revenue   -   Tax   revenue   includes   all   sorts   of   taxes   that   the   Government  
collects.   Broadly,   taxes   can   be   classified   as   'Direct   Taxes'   and   'Indirect   Taxes'.  
zerodha.com/varsity    
418    

419    
The   direct   taxes   include   taxes   paid   by   individuals,   called   the   'Personal   Income  
taxes'   and   the   corporates'   taxes,   called   the   'Corporate   Income   tax'.   
Indirect   taxes   mainly   include   the   tax   in   the   form   of   'GST'.   
As   you   can   see,   India   Inc   collected   close   to   14.8L   Crore   as   taxes   in   2018-19;  
this   includes   both   direct   and   indirect   taxes.   
Remember,   when   GST   is   charged,   a   portion   goes   to   the   state   and   a   portion   to  
the   centre.   Hence   when   you   look   at   14.8LCr,   this   is   the   'net   to   the   centre',  
which   means   that   the   actual   tax   collection   is   higher   than   14.8L   Cr.   Of   course,  
you   can   get   the   exact   value   by   inspecting   this   report   further,   but   I'll   refrain 
from   doing   so.   But   if   I   remember   right,   roughly   2/3rd   is   retained   by   the   centre,  
1/3   is   distributed   to   states.   
Non-tax   revenue   -   Apart   from   the   tax   revenue,   the   Government   has   a   'non-tax  
revenue'   as   an   income   source.   The   non-tax   revenue   source   mainly   includes  
the   dividends   paid   out   by   the   PSU   companies   (companies   like   LIC,   NTPCL,  
ONGC,   NALCO   etc.),   where   the   Government   of   India   is   a   majority   stakeholder.  
Apart   from   dividend   income,   the   Government   also   has   revenue   by   selling  
stakes   in   these   companies,   oen   referred   to   as   the   disinvestment   program.  
The   non-tax   revenue   for   2018-19   was   roughly   2.4L   Cr.   
Total   revenue   is   the   sum   of   these   two   revenue   lines,   which   is   roughly   18.2L   Cr.   
The   Government   has   expenses,   and   these   expenses   can   be   categorized   into  
two   buckets,   i.e.   the   'Revenue   Expenditure'   and   'Capital   Expenditure.   
Revenue   Expenditure   -   These   expenditures   include   subsidies   across   various  
Government   schemes,   salaries   to   Govt   employees,   interest   payments   etc.   The  
zerodha.com/varsity    
419    

420    
revenue   expenditure   is   a   big   bill   that   the   Govt   has   to   pay,   and   as   we   can   see  
from   the   snapshot,   this   bill   stood   at   21.4L.   
Capital   Expenditure   -   The   capital   expenditure,   on   the   other   hand,   is   the  
Government's   expenditure   on   infrastructure;   this   includes   things   like   roads,  
bridges,   hospitals,   electrical   grids,   transportation   etc.   The   capital   expenditure  
is   3.1L   Crore.   
Think   about   it,   capital   expenditure   is   3.1L   Cr,   while   the   revenue   expenditure   is  
nearly   seven   times   more   at   21L   Cr.   If   the   Govt   were   to   spend   more   on   Capital  
expenditure,   it   leads   to   better   infrastructure,   spurs   business   growth,   creates  
jobs,   and   leads   to   better   tax   collection.   
As   a   long-term   investor,   you   need   to   keep   track   of   trends   in   these   spend  
patterns   and   get   a   sense   of   how   the   country   is   evolving.   
The   sum   of   revenue   and   capital   expenditure   is   the   total   expenditure   of   the  
Govt,   which   is   roughly   24.57Cr.   
So,   on   the   one   hand,   Govt   collected   revenue   of   18.2L   Cr,   and   on   the   other  
hand,   the   expenses   stood   at   24.57Cr.   The   expenses   are   much   higher   than   the  
income.   The   negative   diﬀerence,   i.e.   to   the   extent   of   nearly   6.3L   Cr,   is   called  
the   'Fiscal   Deficit'.   
From   the   same   report,   I've   pulled   the   GDP   data   -   
zerodha.com/varsity    
420    

421    
 
The   country's   GDP   as   per   2018-19   data   is   190.1L   Crore.   If   you   calculate   the  
Fiscal   Deficit   as   a   percentage   of   GDP   -   
6.3L   Cr   /   190.1L   Cr   
=   3.3%   
Any   macroeconomic   debate   or   discussion,   this   is   the   ratio   that   gets   spoken  
about   the   most.   The   Government   puts   in   massive   eﬀorts   to   contain   the   Fiscal  
Deficit   to   GDP   ratio   to   sub   4%.   
To   put   this   in   perspective,   do   check   this   extract   from   Wikipedia   -   
 
The   US's   fiscal   deficit   as   a   percentage   of   GDP   is   nearly   4.7%,   which   is   quite  
staggering.   
zerodha.com/varsity    
421    

422    
While   at   it,   we   can   crunch   one   more   data   point,   i.e.   net   tax   collected   as   a  
percentage   of   GDP   -   
=   17.3/190.1   
=   9.1%   
If   we   include   the   share   of   state's,   this   ratio   is   roughly   at   11-12%.   Tax   collection  
as   a   percentage   of   GDP   is   an   important   metric;   remember,   the   higher   the   tax  
collection,   the   higher   is   the   revenue,   which   means   the   probability   of  
shrinking   the   fiscal   deficit   is   higher.   
So   what   will   lead   to   higher   tax   collection?   Things   like   newer   job   creation,  
business   expansion,   improvement   in   ease   of   doing   business,   greater  
compliance,   etc.,   result   in   higher   tax   collection.   
Again,   to   remind   you,   you   need   to   track   these   numbers   to   understand   how  
the   country   operates.   Remember,   when   you   invest   in   the   long   term,   your  
fortunes   depend   on   how   your   investments   perform,   depending   on   how   India  
as   a   country   performs.   
Without   a   sense   of   these   basic   details,   it   is   equivalent   to   investing   in   the   dark.   
I'll   end   this   discussion   here;   as   you   can   imagine,   the   topic   is   vast,   and   we   have  
only   scratched   the   surface   
🙂
   
With   this,   we   are   at   the   end   of   this   module   on   the   Personal   Finance   module;   I  
hope   you'd   enjoyed   reading   this,   as   much   I   enjoyed   writing   this   for   you.   
Good   luck   and   invest   wisely

Key   takeaways   from   this   chapter   
● The   country's   GDP   represents   the   country's   collective  
economic   output;   this   includes   all   the   goods   and   services  
produced   within   the   country's   geographic   boundary.   
● The   nominal   GDP   growth   rate   is   the   GDP's   absolute   growth  
rate;   it   does   not   adjust   for   inflation.   
● The   real   GDP   growth   rate   adjusts   for   inflation.   
● With   2.6   to   2.9   Trillion   USD,   India's   GDP   stands   at  
5th/6thposition   in   the   global   GDP   rank.   
● As   the   GDP   of   the   country   expands,   the   market   cap   also   tends 
to   expand.   
● India   Inc's   revenue   consists   of   tax   and   non-tax   revenue.   
● India,   Inc's   expense   consists   of   revenue   and   capital  
